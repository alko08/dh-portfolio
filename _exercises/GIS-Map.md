title: GIS Map of Chapter 5 & 10
description: A map of the locations from Gibbon's fifth and tenth chapter overlayed on the roman empire.
---

<p>The map I made contains the provided data from chapter 5 along with my own data of the locations mentioned in chapter 10, overlayed ontop of the Roman Empire. Getting all 3 layers to look well together was hard, but I tried my best to choose colors that at least were different and hopefully allow the user to see all three layers at once when they are overlaid on top of each other. The chapter 5 and chapter 10 layers are heat maps that are determined by the frequency of the place mentioned. The more a place was mentioned in a chapter, the "hotter" the heat map is for that data point. The Roman Empire is just a layer containing the shape of the Roman Empire in 200 AD for reference! I have included an emebed version of the map below, but <a href="https://arcg.is/1mbDeH0">here is a link</a> to the map aswell.</p>
