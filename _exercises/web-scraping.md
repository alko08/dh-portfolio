/*
The following CSS variables define the main, public API for styling JupyterLab.
These variables should be used by all plugins wherever possible. In other
words, plugins should not define custom colors, sizes, etc unless absolutely
necessary. This enables users to change the visual theme of JupyterLab
by changing these variables.

Many variables appear in an ordered sequence (0,1,2,3). These sequences
are designed to work well together, so for example, `--jp-border-color1` should
be used with `--jp-layout-color1`. The numbers have the following meanings:

* 0: super-primary, reserved for special emphasis
* 1: primary, most important under normal situations
* 2: secondary, next most important under normal situations
* 3: tertiary, next most important under normal situations

Throughout JupyterLab, we are mostly following principles from Google's
Material Design when selecting colors. We are not, however, following
all of MD as it is not optimized for dense, information rich UIs.

<p>In this assignment, you are tasked with:</p>
<ul>
<li>selecting any text that is interesting to you from Project Gutenberg (<a href="https://www.gutenberg.org/">https://www.gutenberg.org/</a>) (keep in mind that this text should have large divisions like chapters, books, parts etc...)</li>
<li>scraping the text and ONLY the text</li>
<li>creating a <code>DataFrame</code> from your scraped data and saving it as a <code>CSV</code></li>
</ul>
<p>Do your best to strip out any text that is not directly part of the chosen work. It can be difficult sometimes to tell, but this means footnotes, bibliographies, editor's notes do not count. These can provide interesting details, but the purpose of this assignment is to get comfortable with <code>BeautifulSoup</code> and its versitility with filtering text. If you are having trouble, feel free to reach out at peter.nadel@tufts.edu.</p>
<p>Good luck!</p>

&lt;p class=&#34;poem&#34;&gt;
Nil sapientiæ odiosius acumine nimio.—&lt;i&gt;Seneca&lt;/i&gt;.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
      At Paris, just after dark one gusty evening in the autumn of 18-, I was
      enjoying the twofold luxury of meditation and a meerschaum, in company
      with my friend C. Auguste Dupin, in his little back library, or
      book-closet, &lt;i&gt;au troisième&lt;/i&gt;, No. 33, &lt;i&gt;Rue Dunôt, Faubourg St. Germain&lt;/i&gt;. For
      one hour at least we had maintained a profound silence; while each, to any
      casual observer, might have seemed intently and exclusively occupied with
      the curling eddies of smoke that oppressed the atmosphere of the chamber.
      For myself, however, I was mentally discussing certain topics which had
      formed matter for conversation between us at an earlier period of the
      evening; I mean the affair of the Rue Morgue, and the mystery attending
      the murder of Marie Rogêt. I looked upon it, therefore, as something of a
      coincidence, when the door of our apartment was thrown open and admitted
      our old acquaintance, Monsieur G——, the Prefect of the Parisian
      police.
    &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
      We gave him a hearty welcome; for there was nearly half as much of the
      entertaining as of the contemptible about the man, and we had not seen him
      for several years. We had been sitting in the dark, and Dupin now arose
      for the purpose of lighting a lamp, but sat down again, without doing so,
      upon G.‘s saying that he had called to consult us, or rather to ask the
      opinion of my friend, about some official business which had occasioned a
      great deal of trouble.
    &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
      “If it is any point requiring reflection,” observed Dupin, as he forebore
      to enkindle the wick, “we shall examine it to better purpose in the dark.”
     &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
      “That is another of your odd notions,” said the Prefect, who had a fashion
      of calling every thing “odd” that was beyond his comprehension, and thus
      lived amid an absolute legion of “oddities.”
     &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
      “Very true,” said Dupin, as he supplied his visitor with a pipe, and
      rolled towards him a comfortable chair.
    &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
      “And what is the difficulty now?” I asked. “Nothing more in the
      assassination way, I hope?”
     &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
      “Oh no; nothing of that nature. The fact is, the business is very simple
      indeed, and I make no doubt that we can manage it sufficiently well
      ourselves; but then I thought Dupin would like to hear the details of it,
      because it is so excessively odd.”
     &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
      “Simple and odd,” said Dupin.
    &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
      “Why, yes; and not exactly that, either. The fact is, we have all been a
      good deal puzzled because the affair is so simple, and yet baffles us
      altogether.”
     &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
      “Perhaps it is the very simplicity of the thing which puts you at fault,”
       said my friend.
    &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
      “What nonsense you do talk!” replied the Prefect, laughing heartily.
    &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
      “Perhaps the mystery is a little too plain,” said Dupin.
    &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
      “Oh, good heavens! who ever heard of such an idea?”
     &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
      “A little too self-evident.”
     &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
      “Ha! ha! ha—ha! ha! ha!—ho! ho! ho!” roared our visitor,
      profoundly amused, “oh, Dupin, you will be the death of me yet!”
     &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
      “And what, after all, is the matter on hand?” I asked.
    &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
      “Why, I will tell you,” replied the Prefect, as he gave a long, steady and
      contemplative puff, and settled himself in his chair. “I will tell you in
      a few words; but, before I begin, let me caution you that this is an
      affair demanding the greatest secrecy, and that I should most probably
      lose the position I now hold, were it known that I confided it to any
      one.”
     &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
      “Proceed,” said I.
    &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
      “Or not,” said Dupin.
    &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
      “Well, then; I have received personal information, from a very high
      quarter, that a certain document of the last importance has been
      purloined from the royal apartments. The individual who purloined it is
      known; this beyond a doubt; he was seen to take it. It is known, also,
      that it still remains in his possession.”
     &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
      “How is this known?” asked Dupin.
    &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
      “It is clearly inferred,” replied the Prefect, “from the nature of the
      document, and from the non-appearance of certain results which would at
      once arise from its passing out of the robber’s possession; that is to
      say, from his employing it as he must design in the end to employ it.”
     &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
      “Be a little more explicit,” I said.
    &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
      “Well, I may venture so far as to say that the paper gives its holder a
      certain power in a certain quarter where such power is immensely
      valuable.” The Prefect was fond of the cant of diplomacy.
    &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
      “Still I do not quite understand,” said Dupin.
    &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
      “No? Well; the disclosure of the document to a third person, who shall be
      nameless, would bring in question the honor of a personage of most exalted
      station; and this fact gives the holder of the document an ascendancy over
      the illustrious personage whose honor and peace are so jeopardized.”
     &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
      “But this ascendancy,” I interposed, “would depend upon the robber’s
      knowledge of the loser’s knowledge of the robber. Who would dare—”
     &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
      “The thief,” said G., “is the Minister D——, who dares all things,
      those unbecoming as well as those becoming a man. The method of the theft
      was not less ingenious than bold. The document in question—a letter,
      to be frank—had been received by the personage robbed while alone in
      the royal boudoir. During its perusal she was suddenly interrupted by the
      entrance of the other exalted personage from whom especially it was her
      wish to conceal it. After a hurried and vain endeavor to thrust it in a
      drawer, she was forced to place it, open as it was, upon a table. The
      address, however, was uppermost, and, the contents thus unexposed, the
      letter escaped notice. At this juncture enters the Minister D——. His
      lynx eye immediately perceives the paper, recognises the handwriting of
      the address, observes the confusion of the personage addressed, and
      fathoms her secret. After some business transactions, hurried through in
      his ordinary manner, he produces a letter somewhat similar to the one in
      question, opens it, pretends to read it, and then places it in close
      juxtaposition to the other. Again he converses, for some fifteen minutes,
      upon the public affairs. At length, in taking leave, he takes also from
      the table the letter to which he had no claim. Its rightful owner saw,
      but, of course, dared not call attention to the act, in the presence of
      the third personage who stood at her elbow. The minister decamped; leaving
      his own letter—one of no importance—upon the table.”
     &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
      “Here, then,” said Dupin to me, “you have precisely what you demand to
      make the ascendancy complete—the robber’s knowledge of the loser’s
      knowledge of the robber.”
     &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
      “Yes,” replied the Prefect; “and the power thus attained has, for some
      months past, been wielded, for political purposes, to a very dangerous
      extent. The personage robbed is more thoroughly convinced, every day, of
      the necessity of reclaiming her letter. But this, of course, cannot be
      done openly. In fine, driven to despair, she has committed the matter to
      me.”
     &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
      “Than whom,” said Dupin, amid a perfect whirlwind of smoke, “no more
      sagacious agent could, I suppose, be desired, or even imagined.”
     &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
      “You flatter me,” replied the Prefect; “but it is possible that some such
      opinion may have been entertained.”
     &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
      “It is clear,” said I, “as you observe, that the letter is still in
      possession of the minister; since it is this possession, and not any
      employment of the letter, which bestows the power. With the employment the
      power departs.”
     &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
      “True,” said G.; “and upon this conviction I proceeded. My first care was
      to make thorough search of the minister’s hotel; and here my chief
      embarrassment lay in the necessity of searching without his knowledge.
      Beyond all things, I have been warned of the danger which would result
      from giving him reason to suspect our design.”
     &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
      “But,” said I, “you are quite au fait in these investigations. The
      Parisian police have done this thing often before.”
     &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
      “Oh, yes; and for this reason I did not despair. The habits of the minister
      gave me, too, a great advantage. He is frequently absent from home all
      night. His servants are by no means numerous. They sleep at a distance
      from their master’s apartment, and, being chiefly Neapolitans, are readily
      made drunk. I have keys, as you know, with which I can open any chamber or
      cabinet in Paris. For three months a night has not passed, during the
      greater part of which I have not been engaged, personally, in ransacking
      the D—— Hotel. My honor is interested, and, to mention a great
      secret, the reward is enormous. So I did not abandon the search until I
      had become fully satisfied that the thief is a more astute man than
      myself. I fancy that I have investigated every nook and corner of the
      premises in which it is possible that the paper can be concealed.”
     &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
      “But is it not possible,” I suggested, “that although the letter may be in
      possession of the minister, as it unquestionably is, he may have concealed
      it elsewhere than upon his own premises?”
     &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
      “This is barely possible,” said Dupin. “The present peculiar condition of
      affairs at court, and especially of those intrigues in which D—— is
      known to be involved, would render the instant availability of the
      document—its susceptibility of being produced at a moment’s notice—a
      point of nearly equal importance with its possession.”
     &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
      “Its susceptibility of being produced?” said I.
    &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
      “That is to say, of being destroyed,” said Dupin.
    &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
      “True,” I observed; “the paper is clearly then upon the premises. As for
      its being upon the person of the minister, we may consider that as out of
      the question.”
     &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
      “Entirely,” said the Prefect. “He has been twice waylaid, as if by
      footpads, and his person rigorously searched under my own inspection.”
     &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
      “You might have spared yourself this trouble,” said Dupin. “D——, I
      presume, is not altogether a fool, and, if not, must have anticipated
      these waylayings, as a matter of course.”
     &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
      “Not altogether a fool,” said G., “but then he’s a poet, which I take to
      be only one remove from a fool.”
     &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
      “True,” said Dupin, after a long and thoughtful whiff from his meerschaum,
      “although I have been guilty of certain doggrel myself.”
     &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
      “Suppose you detail,” said I, “the particulars of your search.”
     &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
      “Why the fact is, we took our time, and we searched &lt;i&gt;everywhere&lt;/i&gt;. I have
      had long experience in these affairs. I took the entire building, room by
      room; devoting the nights of a whole week to each. We examined, first, the
      furniture of each apartment. We opened every possible drawer; and I
      presume you know that, to a properly trained police agent, such a thing as
      a secret drawer is impossible. Any man is a dolt who permits a ‘secret’ 
      drawer to escape him in a search of this kind. The thing is so plain.
      There is a certain amount of bulk—of space—to be accounted for
      in every cabinet. Then we have accurate rules. The fiftieth part of a line
      could not escape us. After the cabinets we took the chairs. The cushions
      we probed with the fine long needles you have seen me employ. From the
      tables we removed the tops.”
     &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
      “Why so?”
     &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
      “Sometimes the top of a table, or other similarly arranged piece of
      furniture, is removed by the person wishing to conceal an article; then
      the leg is excavated, the article deposited within the cavity, and the top
      replaced. The bottoms and tops of bedposts are employed in the same way.”
     &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
      “But could not the cavity be detected by sounding?” I asked.
    &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
      “By no means, if, when the article is deposited, a sufficient wadding of
      cotton be placed around it. Besides, in our case, we were obliged to
      proceed without noise.”
     &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
      “But you could not have removed—you could not have taken to pieces
      all articles of furniture in which it would have been possible to make a
      deposit in the manner you mention. A letter may be compressed into a thin
      spiral roll, not differing much in shape or bulk from a large
      knitting-needle, and in this form it might be inserted into the rung of a
      chair, for example. You did not take to pieces all the chairs?”
     &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
      “Certainly not; but we did better—we examined the rungs of every
      chair in the hotel, and, indeed the jointings of every description of
      furniture, by the aid of a most powerful microscope. Had there been any
      traces of recent disturbance we should not have failed to detect it
      instantly. A single grain of gimlet-dust, for example, would have been as
      obvious as an apple. Any disorder in the glueing—any unusual gaping
      in the joints—would have sufficed to insure detection.”
     &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
      “I presume you looked to the mirrors, between the boards and the plates,
      and you probed the beds and the bed-clothes, as well as the curtains and
      carpets.”
     &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
      “That of course; and when we had absolutely completed every particle of
      the furniture in this way, then we examined the house itself. We divided
      its entire surface into compartments, which we numbered, so that none
      might be missed; then we scrutinized each individual square inch
      throughout the premises, including the two houses immediately adjoining,
      with the microscope, as before.”
     &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
      “The two houses adjoining!” I exclaimed; “you must have had a great deal
      of trouble.”
     &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
      “We had; but the reward offered is prodigious!”
     &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
      “You include the grounds about the houses?”
     &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
      “All the grounds are paved with brick. They gave us comparatively little
      trouble. We examined the moss between the bricks, and found it
      undisturbed.”
     &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
      “You looked among D——‘s papers, of course, and into the books of the
      library?”
     &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
      “Certainly; we opened every package and parcel; we not only opened every
      book, but we turned over every leaf in each volume, not contenting
      ourselves with a mere shake, according to the fashion of some of our
      police officers. We also measured the thickness of every book-cover, with
      the most accurate admeasurement, and applied to each the most jealous
      scrutiny of the microscope. Had any of the bindings been recently meddled
      with, it would have been utterly impossible that the fact should have
      escaped observation. Some five or six volumes, just from the hands of the
      binder, we carefully probed, longitudinally, with the needles.”
     &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
      “You explored the floors beneath the carpets?”
     &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
      “Beyond doubt. We removed every carpet, and examined the boards with the
      microscope.”
     &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
      “And the paper on the walls?”
     &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
      “Yes.”
     &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
      “You looked into the cellars?”
     &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
      “We did.”
     &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
      “Then,” I said, “you have been making a miscalculation, and the letter is
      not upon the premises, as you suppose.”
     &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
      “I fear you are right there,” said the Prefect. “And now, Dupin, what
      would you advise me to do?”
     &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
      “To make a thorough re-search of the premises.”
     &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
      “That is absolutely needless,” replied G——. “I am not more sure that
      I breathe than I am that the letter is not at the Hotel.”
     &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
      “I have no better advice to give you,” said Dupin. “You have, of course,
      an accurate description of the letter?”
     &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
      “Oh yes!”—And here the Prefect, producing a memorandum-book,
      proceeded to read aloud a minute account of the internal, and especially
      of the external appearance of the missing document. Soon after finishing
      the perusal of this description, he took his departure, more entirely
      depressed in spirits than I had ever known the good gentleman before.
     &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
      In about a month afterwards he paid us another visit, and found us
      occupied very nearly as before. He took a pipe and a chair and entered
      into some ordinary conversation. At length I said,—
    &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
      “Well, but G——, what of the purloined letter? I presume you have at
      last made up your mind that there is no such thing as overreaching the
      Minister?”
     &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
      “Confound him, say I—yes; I made the re-examination, however, as
      Dupin suggested—but it was all labor lost, as I knew it would be.”
     &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
      “How much was the reward offered, did you say?” asked Dupin.
    &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
      “Why, a very great deal—a very liberal reward—I don’t like to
      say how much, precisely; but one thing I will say, that I wouldn’t mind
      giving my individual check for fifty thousand francs to any one who could
      obtain me that letter. The fact is, it is becoming of more and more
      importance every day; and the reward has been lately doubled. If it were
      trebled, however, I could do no more than I have done.”
     &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
      “Why, yes,” said Dupin, drawlingly, between the whiffs of his meerschaum,
      “I really—think, G——, you have not exerted yourself—to
      the utmost in this matter. You might—do a little more, I think, eh?”
     &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
      “How?—in what way?” 
    &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
      “Why—puff, puff—you might—puff, puff—employ
      counsel in the matter, eh?—puff, puff, puff. Do you remember the
      story they tell of Abernethy?”
     &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
      “No; hang Abernethy!”
     &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
      “To be sure! hang him and welcome. But, once upon a time, a certain rich
      miser conceived the design of spunging upon this Abernethy for a medical
      opinion. Getting up, for this purpose, an ordinary conversation in a
      private company, he insinuated his case to the physician, as that of an
      imaginary individual.
    &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
      “‘We will suppose,’ said the miser, ‘that his symptoms are such and such;
      now, doctor, what would you have directed him to take?’ 
    &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
      “‘Take!’ said Abernethy, ‘why, take advice, to be sure.’”
     &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
      “But,” said the Prefect, a little discomposed, “I am perfectly willing to
      take advice, and to pay for it. I would really give fifty thousand francs
      to any one who would aid me in the matter.”
     &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
      “In that case,” replied Dupin, opening a drawer, and producing a
      check-book, “you may as well fill me up a check for the amount mentioned.
      When you have signed it, I will hand you the letter.”
     &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
      I was astounded. The Prefect appeared absolutely thunder-stricken. For
      some minutes he remained speechless and motionless, looking incredulously
      at my friend with open mouth, and eyes that seemed starting from their
      sockets; then, apparently recovering himself in some measure, he seized a
      pen, and after several pauses and vacant stares, finally filled up and
      signed a check for fifty thousand francs, and handed it across the table
      to Dupin. The latter examined it carefully and deposited it in his
      pocket-book; then, unlocking an escritoire, took thence a letter and gave
      it to the Prefect. This functionary grasped it in a perfect agony of joy,
      opened it with a trembling hand, cast a rapid glance at its contents, and
      then, scrambling and struggling to the door, rushed at length
      unceremoniously from the room and from the house, without having uttered a
      syllable since Dupin had requested him to fill up the check.
    &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
      When he had gone, my friend entered into some explanations.
    &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
      “The Parisian police,” he said, “are exceedingly able in their way. They
      are persevering, ingenious, cunning, and thoroughly versed in the
      knowledge which their duties seem chiefly to demand. Thus, when G——
      detailed to us his mode of searching the premises at the Hotel D——, I
      felt entire confidence in his having made a satisfactory investigation—so
      far as his labors extended.”
     &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
      “So far as his labors extended?” said I.
    &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
      “Yes,” said Dupin. “The measures adopted were not only the best of their
      kind, but carried out to absolute perfection. Had the letter been
      deposited within the range of their search, these fellows would, beyond a
      question, have found it.”
     &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
      I merely laughed—but he seemed quite serious in all that he said.
    &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
      “The measures, then,” he continued, “were good in their kind, and well
      executed; their defect lay in their being inapplicable to the case, and to
      the man. A certain set of highly ingenious resources are, with the
      Prefect, a sort of Procrustean bed, to which he forcibly adapts his
      designs. But he perpetually errs by being too deep or too shallow for the
      matter in hand; and many a schoolboy is a better reasoner than he. I knew
      one about eight years of age, whose success at guessing in the game of
      ‘even and odd’ attracted universal admiration. This game is simple, and is
      played with marbles. One player holds in his hand a number of these toys,
      and demands of another whether that number is even or odd. If the guess is
      right, the guesser wins one; if wrong, he loses one. The boy to whom I
      allude won all the marbles of the school. Of course he had some principle
      of guessing; and this lay in mere observation and admeasurement of the
      astuteness of his opponents. For example, an arrant simpleton is his
      opponent, and, holding up his closed hand, asks, ‘are they even or odd?’ 
      Our schoolboy replies, ‘odd,’ and loses; but upon the second trial he
      wins, for he then says to himself, ‘the simpleton had them even upon the
      first trial, and his amount of cunning is just sufficient to make him have
      them odd upon the second; I will therefore guess odd;’—he guesses
      odd, and wins. Now, with a simpleton a degree above the first, he would
      have reasoned thus: ‘This fellow finds that in the first instance I
      guessed odd, and, in the second, he will propose to himself, upon the
      first impulse, a simple variation from even to odd, as did the first
      simpleton; but then a second thought will suggest that this is too simple
      a variation, and finally he will decide upon putting it even as before. I
      will therefore guess even;’—he guesses even, and wins. Now this mode
      of reasoning in the schoolboy, whom his fellows termed ‘lucky,’—what,
      in its last analysis, is it?”
     &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
      “It is merely,” I said, “an identification of the reasoner’s intellect
      with that of his opponent.”
     &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
      “It is,” said Dupin; “and, upon inquiring of the boy by what means he
      effected the thorough identification in which his success consisted, I
      received answer as follows: ‘When I wish to find out how wise, or how
      stupid, or how good, or how wicked is any one, or what are his thoughts at
      the moment, I fashion the expression of my face, as accurately as
      possible, in accordance with the expression of his, and then wait to see
      what thoughts or sentiments arise in my mind or heart, as if to match or
      correspond with the expression.’ This response of the schoolboy lies at
      the bottom of all the spurious profundity which has been attributed to
      Rochefoucault, to La Bougive, to Machiavelli, and to Campanella.”
     &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
      “And the identification,” I said, “of the reasoner’s intellect with that
      of his opponent, depends, if I understand you aright, upon the accuracy
      with which the opponent’s intellect is admeasured.”
     &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
      “For its practical value it depends upon this,” replied Dupin; “and the
      Prefect and his cohort fail so frequently, first, by default of this
      identification, and, secondly, by ill-admeasurement, or rather through
      non-admeasurement, of the intellect with which they are engaged. They
      consider only their own ideas of ingenuity; and, in searching for anything
      hidden, advert only to the modes in which they would have hidden it. They
      are right in this much—that their own ingenuity is a faithful
      representative of that of the mass; but when the cunning of the individual
      felon is diverse in character from their own, the felon foils them, of
      course. This always happens when it is above their own, and very usually
      when it is below. They have no variation of principle in their
      investigations; at best, when urged by some unusual emergency—by
      some extraordinary reward—they extend or exaggerate their old modes
      of practice, without touching their principles. What, for example, in this
      case of D——, has been done to vary the principle of action? What is
      all this boring, and probing, and sounding, and scrutinizing with the
      microscope and dividing the surface of the building into registered square
      inches—what is it all but an exaggeration of the application of the
      one principle or set of principles of search, which are based upon the one
      set of notions regarding human ingenuity, to which the Prefect, in the
      long routine of his duty, has been accustomed? Do you not see he has taken
      it for granted that all men proceed to conceal a letter,—not exactly
      in a gimlet hole bored in a chair-leg—but, at least, in some
      out-of-the-way hole or corner suggested by the same tenor of thought which
      would urge a man to secrete a letter in a gimlet-hole bored in a
      chair-leg? And do you not see also, that such recherchés nooks for
      concealment are adapted only for ordinary occasions, and would be adopted
      only by ordinary intellects; for, in all cases of concealment, a disposal
      of the article concealed—a disposal of it in this recherché manner,—is,
      in the very first instance, presumable and presumed; and thus its
      discovery depends, not at all upon the acumen, but altogether upon the
      mere care, patience, and determination of the seekers; and where the case
      is of importance—or, what amounts to the same thing in the political
      eyes, when the reward is of magnitude,—the qualities in question
      have never been known to fail. You will now understand what I meant in
      suggesting that, had the purloined letter been hidden any where within the
      limits of the Prefect’s examination—in other words, had the
      principle of its concealment been comprehended within the principles of
      the Prefect—its discovery would have been a matter altogether beyond
      question. This functionary, however, has been thoroughly mystified; and
      the remote source of his defeat lies in the supposition that the Minister
      is a fool, because he has acquired renown as a poet. All fools are poets;
      this the Prefect feels; and he is merely guilty of a non distributio medii
      in thence inferring that all poets are fools.”
     &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
      “But is this really the poet?” I asked. “There are two brothers, I know;
      and both have attained reputation in letters. The Minister I believe has
      written learnedly on the Differential Calculus. He is a mathematician, and
      no poet.”
     &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
      “You are mistaken; I know him well; he is both. As poet and mathematician,
      he would reason well; as mere mathematician, he could not have reasoned at
      all, and thus would have been at the mercy of the Prefect.”
     &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
      “You surprise me,” I said, “by these opinions, which have been
      contradicted by the voice of the world. You do not mean to set at naught
      the well-digested idea of centuries. The mathematical reason has long been
      regarded as the reason par excellence.”
     &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
      “‘Il y a à parièr,’” replied Dupin, quoting from Chamfort, “‘que toute
      idée publique, toute convention reçue est une sottise, car elle a convenue
      au plus grand nombre.’ The mathematicians, I grant you, have done their
      best to promulgate the popular error to which you allude, and which is
      none the less an error for its promulgation as truth. With an art worthy a
      better cause, for example, they have insinuated the term ‘analysis’ into
      application to algebra. The French are the originators of this particular
      deception; but if a term is of any importance—if words derive any
      value from applicability—then ‘analysis’ conveys ‘algebra’ about as
      much as, in Latin, ‘ambitus’ implies ‘ambition,’ ‘&lt;i&gt;religio&lt;/i&gt;’ ‘religion,’ or
      ‘&lt;i&gt;homines honesti&lt;/i&gt;’ a set of &lt;i&gt;honorable&lt;/i&gt; men.”
     &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
      “You have a quarrel on hand, I see,” said I, “with some of the algebraists
      of Paris; but proceed.”
     &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
      “I dispute the availability, and thus the value, of that reason which is
      cultivated in any especial form other than the abstractly logical. I
      dispute, in particular, the reason educed by mathematical study. The
      mathematics are the science of form and quantity; mathematical reasoning
      is merely logic applied to observation upon form and quantity. The great
      error lies in supposing that even the truths of what is called pure
      algebra, are abstract or general truths. And this error is so egregious
      that I am confounded at the universality with which it has been received.
      Mathematical axioms are not axioms of general truth. What is true of
      relation—of form and quantity—is often grossly false in regard
      to morals, for example. In this latter science it is very usually untrue
      that the aggregated parts are equal to the whole. In chemistry also the
      axiom fails. In the consideration of motive it fails; for two motives,
      each of a given value, have not, necessarily, a value when united, equal
      to the sum of their values apart. There are numerous other mathematical
      truths which are only truths within the limits of relation. But the
      mathematician argues, from his finite truths, through habit, as if they
      were of an absolutely general applicability—as the world indeed
      imagines them to be. Bryant, in his very learned ‘Mythology,’ mentions an
      analogous source of error, when he says that ‘although the Pagan fables
      are not believed, yet we forget ourselves continually, and make inferences
      from them as existing realities.’ With the algebraists, however, who are
      Pagans themselves, the ‘Pagan fables’ are believed, and the inferences are
      made, not so much through lapse of memory, as through an unaccountable
      addling of the brains. In short, I never yet encountered the mere
      mathematician who could be trusted out of equal roots, or one who did not
      clandestinely hold it as a point of his faith that x&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;+px was
      absolutely and unconditionally equal to q. Say to one of these gentlemen,
      by way of experiment, if you please, that you believe occasions may occur
      where x&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;+px is not altogether equal to q, and, having made him
      understand what you mean, get out of his reach as speedily as convenient,
      for, beyond doubt, he will endeavor to knock you down.
    &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
      “I mean to say,” continued Dupin, while I merely laughed at his last
      observations, “that if the Minister had been no more than a mathematician,
      the Prefect would have been under no necessity of giving me this check. I
      know him, however, as both mathematician and poet, and my measures were
      adapted to his capacity, with reference to the circumstances by which he
      was surrounded. I knew him as a courtier, too, and as a bold intriguant.
      Such a man, I considered, could not fail to be aware of the ordinary
      policial modes of action. He could not have failed to anticipate—and
      events have proved that he did not fail to anticipate—the waylayings
      to which he was subjected. He must have foreseen, I reflected, the secret
      investigations of his premises. His frequent absences from home at night,
      which were hailed by the Prefect as certain aids to his success, I
      regarded only as ruses, to afford opportunity for thorough search to the
      police, and thus the sooner to impress them with the conviction to which G——,
      in fact, did finally arrive—the conviction that the letter was not
      upon the premises. I felt, also, that the whole train of thought, which I
      was at some pains in detailing to you just now, concerning the invariable
      principle of policial action in searches for articles concealed—I
      felt that this whole train of thought would necessarily pass through the
      mind of the Minister. It would imperatively lead him to despise all the
      ordinary nooks of concealment. He could not, I reflected, be so weak as
      not to see that the most intricate and remote recess of his hotel would be
      as open as his commonest closets to the eyes, to the probes, to the
      gimlets, and to the microscopes of the Prefect. I saw, in fine, that he
      would be driven, as a matter of course, to simplicity, if not deliberately
      induced to it as a matter of choice. You will remember, perhaps, how
      desperately the Prefect laughed when I suggested, upon our first
      interview, that it was just possible this mystery troubled him so much on
      account of its being so very self-evident.”
     &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
      “Yes,” said I, “I remember his merriment well. I really thought he would
      have fallen into convulsions.”
     &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
      “The material world,” continued Dupin, “abounds with very strict analogies
      to the immaterial; and thus some color of truth has been given to the
      rhetorical dogma, that metaphor, or simile, may be made to strengthen an
      argument, as well as to embellish a description. The principle of the vis
      inertiæ, for example, seems to be identical in physics and metaphysics. It
      is not more true in the former, that a large body is with more difficulty
      set in motion than a smaller one, and that its subsequent momentum is
      commensurate with this difficulty, than it is, in the latter, that
      intellects of the vaster capacity, while more forcible, more constant, and
      more eventful in their movements than those of inferior grade, are yet the
      less readily moved, and more embarrassed and full of hesitation in the
      first few steps of their progress. Again: have you ever noticed which of
      the street signs, over the shop-doors, are the most attractive of
      attention?”
     &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
      “I have never given the matter a thought,” I said.
    &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
      “There is a game of puzzles,” he resumed, “which is played upon a map. One
      party playing requires another to find a given word—the name of
      town, river, state or empire—any word, in short, upon the motley and
      perplexed surface of the chart. A novice in the game generally seeks to
      embarrass his opponents by giving them the most minutely lettered names;
      but the adept selects such words as stretch, in large characters, from one
      end of the chart to the other. These, like the over-largely lettered signs
      and placards of the street, escape observation by dint of being
      excessively obvious; and here the physical oversight is precisely
      analogous with the moral inapprehension by which the intellect suffers to
      pass unnoticed those considerations which are too obtrusively and too
      palpably self-evident. But this is a point, it appears, somewhat above or
      beneath the understanding of the Prefect. He never once thought it
      probable, or possible, that the Minister had deposited the letter
      immediately beneath the nose of the whole world, by way of best preventing
      any portion of that world from perceiving it.
    &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
      “But the more I reflected upon the daring, dashing, and discriminating
      ingenuity of D——; upon the fact that the document must always have
      been at hand, if he intended to use it to good purpose; and upon the
      decisive evidence, obtained by the Prefect, that it was not hidden within
      the limits of that dignitary’s ordinary search—the more satisfied I
      became that, to conceal this letter, the Minister had resorted to the
      comprehensive and sagacious expedient of not attempting to conceal it at
      all.
    &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
      “Full of these ideas, I prepared myself with a pair of green spectacles,
      and called one fine morning, quite by accident, at the Ministerial hotel.
      I found D—— at home, yawning, lounging, and dawdling, as usual, and
      pretending to be in the last extremity of ennui. He is, perhaps, the most
      really energetic human being now alive—but that is only when nobody
      sees him.
    &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
      “To be even with him, I complained of my weak eyes, and lamented the
      necessity of the spectacles, under cover of which I cautiously and
      thoroughly surveyed the whole apartment, while seemingly intent only upon
      the conversation of my host.
    &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
      “I paid especial attention to a large writing-table near which he sat, and
      upon which lay confusedly, some miscellaneous letters and other papers,
      with one or two musical instruments and a few books. Here, however, after
      a long and very deliberate scrutiny, I saw nothing to excite particular
      suspicion.
    &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
      “At length my eyes, in going the circuit of the room, fell upon a trumpery
      fillagree card-rack of pasteboard, that hung dangling by a dirty blue
      ribbon, from a little brass knob just beneath the middle of the
      mantel-piece. In this rack, which had three or four compartments, were
      five or six visiting cards and a solitary letter. This last was much
      soiled and crumpled. It was torn nearly in two, across the middle—as
      if a design, in the first instance, to tear it entirely up as worthless,
      had been altered, or stayed, in the second. It had a large black seal,
      bearing the D—— cipher &lt;i&gt;very&lt;/i&gt; conspicuously, and was addressed, in a
      diminutive female hand, to D——, the minister, himself. It was thrust
      carelessly, and even, as it seemed, contemptuously, into one of the
      uppermost divisions of the rack.
    &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
      “No sooner had I glanced at this letter, than I concluded it to be that of
      which I was in search. To be sure, it was, to all appearance, radically
      different from the one of which the Prefect had read us so minute a
      description. Here the seal was large and black, with the D—— cipher;
      there it was small and red, with the ducal arms of the S—— family.
      Here, the address, to the Minister, diminutive and feminine; there the
      superscription, to a certain royal personage, was markedly bold and
      decided; the size alone formed a point of correspondence. But, then, the
      radicalness of these differences, which was excessive; the dirt; the
      soiled and torn condition of the paper, so inconsistent with the true
      methodical habits of D——, and so suggestive of a design to delude the
      beholder into an idea of the worthlessness of the document—these things,
      together with the hyper-obtrusive situation of this document, full in the
      view of every visitor, and thus exactly in accordance with the conclusions
      to which I had previously arrived; these things, I say, were strongly
      corroborative of suspicion, in one who came with the intention to suspect.
    &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
      “I protracted my visit as long as possible, and, while I maintained a most
      animated discussion with the Minister upon a topic which I knew well had
      never failed to interest and excite him, I kept my attention really
      riveted upon the letter. In this examination, I committed to memory its
      external appearance and arrangement in the rack; and also fell, at length,
      upon a discovery which set at rest whatever trivial doubt I might have
      entertained. In scrutinizing the edges of the paper, I observed them to be
      more chafed than seemed necessary. They presented the broken appearance
      which is manifested when a stiff paper, having been once folded and
      pressed with a folder, is refolded in a reversed direction, in the same
      creases or edges which had formed the original fold. This discovery was
      sufficient. It was clear to me that the letter had been turned, as a
      glove, inside out, re-directed, and re-sealed. I bade the Minister good
      morning, and took my departure at once, leaving a gold snuff-box upon the
      table.
    &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
      “The next morning I called for the snuff-box, when we resumed, quite
      eagerly, the conversation of the preceding day. While thus engaged,
      however, a loud report, as if of a pistol, was heard immediately beneath
      the windows of the hotel, and was succeeded by a series of fearful
      screams, and the shoutings of a terrified mob. D—— rushed to a
      casement, threw it open, and looked out. In the meantime, I stepped to the
      card-rack, took the letter, put it in my pocket, and replaced it by a
      fac-simile, (so far as regards externals,) which I had carefully prepared
      at my lodgings—imitating the D—— cipher, very readily, by means
      of a seal formed of bread.
    &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
      “The disturbance in the street had been occasioned by the frantic behavior
      of a man with a musket. He had fired it among a crowd of women and
      children. It proved, however, to have been without ball, and the fellow
      was suffered to go his way as a lunatic or a drunkard. When he had gone, D——
      came from the window, whither I had followed him immediately upon securing
      the object in view. Soon afterwards I bade him farewell. The pretended
      lunatic was a man in my own pay.”
     &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
      “But what purpose had you,” I asked, “in replacing the letter by a
      fac-simile? Would it not have been better, at the first visit, to have
      seized it openly, and departed?”
     &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
      “D——,” replied Dupin, “is a desperate man, and a man of nerve. His
      hotel, too, is not without attendants devoted to his interests. Had I made
      the wild attempt you suggest, I might never have left the Ministerial
      presence alive. The good people of Paris might have heard of me no more.
      But I had an object apart from these considerations. You know my political
      prepossessions. In this matter, I act as a partisan of the lady concerned.
      For eighteen months the Minister has had her in his power. She has now him
      in hers—since, being unaware that the letter is not in his
      possession, he will proceed with his exactions as if it was. Thus will he
      inevitably commit himself, at once, to his political destruction. His
      downfall, too, will not be more precipitate than awkward. It is all very
      well to talk about the facilis descensus Averni; but in all kinds of
      climbing, as Catalani said of singing, it is far more easy to get up than
      to come down. In the present instance I have no sympathy—at least no
      pity—for him who descends. He is that monstrum horrendum, an
      unprincipled man of genius. I confess, however, that I should like very
      well to know the precise character of his thoughts, when, being defied by
      her whom the Prefect terms ‘a certain personage’ he is reduced to opening
      the letter which I left for him in the card-rack.”
     &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
      “How? did you put any thing particular in it?”
     &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
      “Why—it did not seem altogether right to leave the interior blank—that
      would have been insulting. D——, at Vienna once, did me an evil turn,
      which I told him, quite good-humoredly, that I should remember. So, as I
      knew he would feel some curiosity in regard to the identity of the person
      who had outwitted him, I thought it a pity not to give him a clue. He is
      well acquainted with my MS., and I just copied into the middle of the
      blank sheet the words—
    &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&#34;poem&#34;&gt;
      “‘— — Un dessein si funeste,&lt;br/&gt;
      S’il n’est digne d’Atrée, est digne de Thyeste.
     &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
      They are to be found in Crébillon’s ‘Atrée.’”

&lt;h2&gt;&lt;a id=&#34;chap2.2&#34;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;THE THOUSAND-AND-SECOND TALE OF SCHEHERAZADE&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p class=&#34;poem&#34;&gt;
Truth is stranger than fiction.—&lt;i&gt;Old Saying&lt;/i&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
      Having had occasion, lately, in the course of some Oriental
      investigations, to consult the Tellmenow Isitsöornot, a work which (like
      the Zohar of Simeon Jochaides) is scarcely known at all, even in Europe;
      and which has never been quoted, to my knowledge, by any American—if
      we except, perhaps, the author of the “Curiosities of American
      Literature”;—having had occasion, I say, to turn over some pages of
      the first-mentioned very remarkable work, I was not a little astonished to
      discover that the literary world has hitherto been strangely in error
      respecting the fate of the vizier’s daughter, Scheherazade, as that fate
      is depicted in the “Arabian Nights”; and that the &lt;i&gt;dénouement&lt;/i&gt; there given,
      if not altogether inaccurate, as far as it goes, is at least to blame in
      not having gone very much farther.
    &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
      For full information on this interesting topic, I must refer the
      inquisitive reader to the “Isitsöornot” itself; but in the meantime, I
      shall be pardoned for giving a summary of what I there discovered.
    &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
      It will be remembered, that, in the usual version of the tales, a certain
      monarch having good cause to be jealous of his queen, not only puts her to
      death, but makes a vow, by his beard and the prophet, to espouse each
      night the most beautiful maiden in his dominions, and the next morning to
      deliver her up to the executioner.
    &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
      Having fulfilled this vow for many years to the letter, and with a
      religious punctuality and method that conferred great credit upon him as a
      man of devout feeling and excellent sense, he was interrupted one
      afternoon (no doubt at his prayers) by a visit from his grand vizier, to
      whose daughter, it appears, there had occurred an idea.
    &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
      Her name was Scheherazade, and her idea was, that she would either redeem
      the land from the depopulating tax upon its beauty, or perish, after the
      approved fashion of all heroines, in the attempt.
    &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
      Accordingly, and although we do not find it to be leap-year (which makes
      the sacrifice more meritorious), she deputes her father, the grand vizier,
      to make an offer to the king of her hand. This hand the king eagerly
      accepts—(he had intended to take it at all events, and had put off
      the matter from day to day, only through fear of the vizier),—but,
      in accepting it now, he gives all parties very distinctly to understand,
      that, grand vizier or no grand vizier, he has not the slightest design of
      giving up one iota of his vow or of his privileges. When, therefore, the
      fair Scheherazade insisted upon marrying the king, and did actually marry
      him despite her father’s excellent advice not to do any thing of the kind—when
      she would and did marry him, I say, will I, nill I, it was with her
      beautiful black eyes as thoroughly open as the nature of the case would
      allow.
    &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
      It seems, however, that this politic damsel (who had been reading
      Machiavelli, beyond doubt), had a very ingenious little plot in her mind.
      On the night of the wedding, she contrived, upon I forget what specious
      pretence, to have her sister occupy a couch sufficiently near that of the
      royal pair to admit of easy conversation from bed to bed; and, a little
      before cock-crowing, she took care to awaken the good monarch, her husband
      (who bore her none the worse will because he intended to wring her neck on
      the morrow),—she managed to awaken him, I say, (although on account
      of a capital conscience and an easy digestion, he slept well) by the
      profound interest of a story (about a rat and a black cat, I think) which
      she was narrating (all in an undertone, of course) to her sister. When the
      day broke, it so happened that this history was not altogether finished,
      and that Scheherazade, in the nature of things could not finish it just
      then, since it was high time for her to get up and be bowstrung—a
      thing very little more pleasant than hanging, only a trifle more genteel!
    &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
      The king’s curiosity, however, prevailing, I am sorry to say, even over
      his sound religious principles, induced him for this once to postpone the
      fulfilment of his vow until next morning, for the purpose and with the
      hope of hearing that night how it fared in the end with the black cat (a
      black cat, I think it was) and the rat.
    &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
      The night having arrived, however, the lady Scheherazade not only put the
      finishing stroke to the black cat and the rat (the rat was blue) but
      before she well knew what she was about, found herself deep in the
      intricacies of a narration, having reference (if I am not altogether
      mistaken) to a pink horse (with green wings) that went, in a violent
      manner, by clockwork, and was wound up with an indigo key. With this
      history the king was even more profoundly interested than with the other—and,
      as the day broke before its conclusion (notwithstanding all the queen’s
      endeavors to get through with it in time for the bowstringing), there was
      again no resource but to postpone that ceremony as before, for twenty-four
      hours. The next night there happened a similar accident with a similar
      result; and then the next—and then again the next; so that, in the
      end, the good monarch, having been unavoidably deprived of all opportunity
      to keep his vow during a period of no less than one thousand and one
      nights, either forgets it altogether by the expiration of this time, or
      gets himself absolved of it in the regular way, or (what is more probable)
      breaks it outright, as well as the head of his father confessor. At all
      events, Scheherazade, who, being lineally descended from Eve, fell heir,
      perhaps, to the whole seven baskets of talk, which the latter lady, we all
      know, picked up from under the trees in the garden of Eden; Scheherazade,
      I say, finally triumphed, and the tariff upon beauty was repealed.
    &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
      Now, this conclusion (which is that of the story as we have it upon
      record) is, no doubt, excessively proper and pleasant—but alas! like
      a great many pleasant things, is more pleasant than true, and I am
      indebted altogether to the “Isitsöornot” for the means of correcting the
      error. “Le mieux,” says a French proverb, “est l’ennemi du bien,” and, in
      mentioning that Scheherazade had inherited the seven baskets of talk, I
      should have added that she put them out at compound interest until they
      amounted to seventy-seven.
    &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
      “My dear sister,” said she, on the thousand-and-second night, (I quote the
      language of the “Isitsöornot” at this point, verbatim) “my dear sister,”
       said she, “now that all this little difficulty about the bowstring has
      blown over, and that this odious tax is so happily repealed, I feel that I
      have been guilty of great indiscretion in withholding from you and the
      king (who I am sorry to say, snores—a thing no gentleman would do)
      the full conclusion of Sinbad the sailor. This person went through
      numerous other and more interesting adventures than those which I related;
      but the truth is, I felt sleepy on the particular night of their
      narration, and so was seduced into cutting them short—a grievous
      piece of misconduct, for which I only trust that Allah will forgive me.
      But even yet it is not too late to remedy my great neglect—and as
      soon as I have given the king a pinch or two in order to wake him up so
      far that he may stop making that horrible noise, I will forthwith
      entertain you (and him if he pleases) with the sequel of this very
      remarkable story.”
     &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
      Hereupon the sister of Scheherazade, as I have it from the “Isitsöornot,”
       expressed no very particular intensity of gratification; but the king,
      having been sufficiently pinched, at length ceased snoring, and finally
      said, “Hum!” and then “Hoo!” when the queen, understanding these words
      (which are no doubt Arabic) to signify that he was all attention, and
      would do his best not to snore any more—the queen, I say, having
      arranged these matters to her satisfaction, re-entered thus, at once, into
      the history of Sinbad the sailor:
    &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
      “‘At length, in my old age,’ [these are the words of Sinbad himself, as
      retailed by Scheherazade]—‘at length, in my old age, and after
      enjoying many years of tranquillity at home, I became once more possessed
      of a desire of visiting foreign countries; and one day, without
      acquainting any of my family with my design, I packed up some bundles of
      such merchandise as was most precious and least bulky, and, engaging a
      porter to carry them, went with him down to the sea-shore, to await the
      arrival of any chance vessel that might convey me out of the kingdom into
      some region which I had not as yet explored.
    &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
      “‘Having deposited the packages upon the sands, we sat down beneath some
      trees, and looked out into the ocean in the hope of perceiving a ship, but
      during several hours we saw none whatever. At length I fancied that I
      could hear a singular buzzing or humming sound; and the porter, after
      listening awhile, declared that he also could distinguish it. Presently it
      grew louder, and then still louder, so that we could have no doubt that
      the object which caused it was approaching us. At length, on the edge of
      the horizon, we discovered a black speck, which rapidly increased in size
      until we made it out to be a vast monster, swimming with a great part of
      its body above the surface of the sea. It came toward us with
      inconceivable swiftness, throwing up huge waves of foam around its breast,
      and illuminating all that part of the sea through which it passed, with a
      long line of fire that extended far off into the distance.
    &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
      “‘As the thing drew near we saw it very distinctly. Its length was equal
      to that of three of the loftiest trees that grow, and it was as wide as
      the great hall of audience in your palace, O most sublime and munificent
      of the Caliphs. Its body, which was unlike that of ordinary fishes, was as
      solid as a rock, and of a jetty blackness throughout all that portion of
      it which floated above the water, with the exception of a narrow blood-red
      streak that completely begirdled it. The belly, which floated beneath the
      surface, and of which we could get only a glimpse now and then as the
      monster rose and fell with the billows, was entirely covered with metallic
      scales, of a color like that of the moon in misty weather. The back was
      flat and nearly white, and from it there extended upwards of six spines,
      about half the length of the whole body.
    &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
      “‘This horrible creature had no mouth that we could perceive; but, as if to
      make up for this deficiency, it was provided with at least four score of
      eyes, that protruded from their sockets like those of the green
      dragon-fly, and were arranged all around the body in two rows, one above
      the other, and parallel to the blood-red streak, which seemed to answer
      the purpose of an eyebrow. Two or three of these dreadful eyes were much
      larger than the others, and had the appearance of solid gold.
    &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
      “‘Although this beast approached us, as I have before said, with the
      greatest rapidity, it must have been moved altogether by necromancy—for
      it had neither fins like a fish nor web-feet like a duck, nor wings like
      the seashell which is blown along in the manner of a vessel; nor yet did
      it writhe itself forward as do the eels. Its head and its tail were shaped
      precisely alike, only, not far from the latter, were two small holes that
      served for nostrils, and through which the monster puffed out its thick
      breath with prodigious violence, and with a shrieking, disagreeable noise.
    &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
      “‘Our terror at beholding this hideous thing was very great, but it was
      even surpassed by our astonishment, when upon getting a nearer look, we
      perceived upon the creature’s back a vast number of animals about the size
      and shape of men, and altogether much resembling them, except that they
      wore no garments (as men do), being supplied (by nature, no doubt) with an
      ugly uncomfortable covering, a good deal like cloth, but fitting so tight
      to the skin, as to render the poor wretches laughably awkward, and put
      them apparently to severe pain. On the very tips of their heads were
      certain square-looking boxes, which, at first sight, I thought might have
      been intended to answer as turbans, but I soon discovered that they were
      excessively heavy and solid, and I therefore concluded they were
      contrivances designed, by their great weight, to keep the heads of the
      animals steady and safe upon their shoulders. Around the necks of the
      creatures were fastened black collars, (badges of servitude, no doubt,)
      such as we keep on our dogs, only much wider and infinitely stiffer, so
      that it was quite impossible for these poor victims to move their heads in
      any direction without moving the body at the same time; and thus they were
      doomed to perpetual contemplation of their noses—a view puggish and
      snubby in a wonderful, if not positively in an awful degree.
    &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
      “‘When the monster had nearly reached the shore where we stood, it
      suddenly pushed out one of its eyes to a great extent, and emitted from it
      a terrible flash of fire, accompanied by a dense cloud of smoke, and a
      noise that I can compare to nothing but thunder. As the smoke cleared
      away, we saw one of the odd man-animals standing near the head of the
      large beast with a trumpet in his hand, through which (putting it to his
      mouth) he presently addressed us in loud, harsh, and disagreeable accents,
      that, perhaps, we should have mistaken for language, had they not come
      altogether through the nose.
    &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
      “‘Being thus evidently spoken to, I was at a loss how to reply, as I could
      in no manner understand what was said; and in this difficulty I turned to
      the porter, who was near swooning through affright, and demanded of him
      his opinion as to what species of monster it was, what it wanted, and what
      kind of creatures those were that so swarmed upon its back. To this the
      porter replied, as well as he could for trepidation, that he had once
      before heard of this sea-beast; that it was a cruel demon, with bowels of
      sulphur and blood of fire, created by evil genii as the means of
      inflicting misery upon mankind; that the things upon its back were vermin,
      such as sometimes infest cats and dogs, only a little larger and more
      savage; and that these vermin had their uses, however evil—for,
      through the torture they caused the beast by their nibbling and stingings,
      it was goaded into that degree of wrath which was requisite to make it
      roar and commit ill, and so fulfil the vengeful and malicious designs of
      the wicked genii.
    &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
      “This account determined me to take to my heels, and, without once even
      looking behind me, I ran at full speed up into the hills, while the porter
      ran equally fast, although nearly in an opposite direction, so that, by
      these means, he finally made his escape with my bundles, of which I have
      no doubt he took excellent care—although this is a point I cannot
      determine, as I do not remember that I ever beheld him again.
    &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
      “‘For myself, I was so hotly pursued by a swarm of the men-vermin (who had
      come to the shore in boats) that I was very soon overtaken, bound hand and
      foot, and conveyed to the beast, which immediately swam out again into the
      middle of the sea.
    &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
      “‘I now bitterly repented my folly in quitting a comfortable home to peril
      my life in such adventures as this; but regret being useless, I made the
      best of my condition, and exerted myself to secure the goodwill of the
      man-animal that owned the trumpet, and who appeared to exercise authority
      over his fellows. I succeeded so well in this endeavor that, in a few
      days, the creature bestowed upon me various tokens of his favor, and in
      the end even went to the trouble of teaching me the rudiments of what it
      was vain enough to denominate its language; so that, at length, I was
      enabled to converse with it readily, and came to make it comprehend the
      ardent desire I had of seeing the world.
    &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
      “‘Washish squashish squeak, Sinbad, hey-diddle diddle, grunt unt grumble,
      hiss, fiss, whiss,’ said he to me, one day after dinner—but I beg a
      thousand pardons, I had forgotten that your majesty is not conversant with
      the dialect of the Cock-neighs (so the man-animals were called; I presume
      because their language formed the connecting link between that of the
      horse and that of the rooster). With your permission, I will translate.
      ‘Washish squashish,’ and so forth:—that is to say, ‘I am happy to
      find, my dear Sinbad, that you are really a very excellent fellow; we are
      now about doing a thing which is called circumnavigating the globe; and
      since you are so desirous of seeing the world, I will strain a point and
      give you a free passage upon back of the beast.’”
     &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
      When the Lady Scheherazade had proceeded thus far, relates the
      “Isitsöornot,” the king turned over from his left side to his right, and
      said:
    &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
      “It is, in fact, very surprising, my dear queen, that you omitted,
      hitherto, these latter adventures of Sinbad. Do you know I think them
      exceedingly entertaining and strange?”
     &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
      The king having thus expressed himself, we are told, the fair Scheherazade
      resumed her history in the following words:
    &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
      “Sinbad went on in this manner with his narrative—‘I
      thanked the man-animal for its kindness, and soon found myself very much
      at home on the beast, which swam at a prodigious rate through the ocean;
      although the surface of the latter is, in that part of the world, by no
      means flat, but round like a pomegranate, so that we went—so to say—either
      up hill or down hill all the time.’ 
    &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
      “That I think, was very singular,” interrupted the king.
    &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
      “Nevertheless, it is quite true,” replied Scheherazade.
    &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
      “I have my doubts,” rejoined the king; “but, pray, be so good as to go on
      with the story.”
     &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
      “I will,” said the queen. “‘The beast,’ continued Sinbad to the caliph,
      ‘swam, as I have related, up hill and down hill until, at length, we
      arrived at an island, many hundreds of miles in circumference, but which,
      nevertheless, had been built in the middle of the sea by a colony of
      little things like caterpillars.’” (*1)
    &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
      “Hum!” said the king.
    &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
      “‘Leaving this island,’ said Sinbad—(for Scheherazade, it must be
      understood, took no notice of her husband’s ill-mannered ejaculation)
      ‘leaving this island, we came to another where the forests were of solid
      stone, and so hard that they shivered to pieces the finest-tempered axes
      with which we endeavoured to cut them down.’” (*2)
    &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
      “Hum!” said the king, again; but Scheherazade, paying him no attention,
      continued in the language of Sinbad.
    &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
      “‘Passing beyond this last island, we reached a country where there was a
      cave that ran to the distance of thirty or forty miles within the bowels
      of the earth, and that contained a greater number of far more spacious and
      more magnificent palaces than are to be found in all Damascus and Bagdad.
      From the roofs of these palaces there hung myriads of gems, like
      diamonds, but larger than men; and in among the streets of towers and
      pyramids and temples, there flowed immense rivers as black as ebony, and
      swarming with fish that had no eyes.’” (*3)
    &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
      “Hum!” said the king.
    &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
      “‘We then swam into a region of the sea where we found a
      lofty mountain, down whose sides there streamed torrents of melted metal,
      some of which were twelve miles wide and sixty miles long (*4); while
      from an abyss on the summit, issued so vast a quantity of ashes that the
      sun was entirely blotted out from the heavens, and it became darker than
      the darkest midnight; so that when we were even at the distance of a
      hundred and fifty miles from the mountain, it was impossible to see the
      whitest object, however close we held it to our eyes.’” (*5)
    &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
      “Hum!” said the king.
    &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
      “‘After quitting this coast, the beast continued his voyage until we met
      with a land in which the nature of things seemed reversed—for we
      here saw a great lake, at the bottom of which, more than a hundred feet
      beneath the surface of the water, there flourished in full leaf a forest
      of tall and luxuriant trees.’” (*6)
    &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
      “Hoo!” said the king.
    &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
      “Some hundred miles farther on brought us to a climate where the
      atmosphere was so dense as to sustain iron or steel, just as our own does
      feather.’” (*7)
    &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
      “Fiddle de dee,” said the king.
    &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
      “Proceeding still in the same direction, we presently arrived at the most
      magnificent region in the whole world. Through it there meandered a
      glorious river for several thousands of miles. This river was of
      unspeakable depth, and of a transparency richer than that of amber. It was
      from three to six miles in width; and its banks which arose on either side
      to twelve hundred feet in perpendicular height, were crowned with
      ever-blossoming trees and perpetual sweet-scented flowers, that made the
      whole territory one gorgeous garden; but the name of this luxuriant land
      was the Kingdom of Horror, and to enter it was inevitable death.’” (*8)
    &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
      “Humph!” said the king.
    &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
      “‘We left this kingdom in great haste, and, after some days, came to
      another, where we were astonished to perceive myriads of monstrous animals
      with horns resembling scythes upon their heads. These hideous beasts dig
      for themselves vast caverns in the soil, of a funnel shape, and line the
      sides of them with rocks, so disposed one upon the other that they fall
      instantly, when trodden upon by other animals, thus precipitating them
      into the monster’s dens, where their blood is immediately sucked, and
      their carcasses afterwards hurled contemptuously out to an immense
      distance from “the caverns of death.&#34;’” (*9)
    &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
      “Pooh!” said the king.
    &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
      “‘Continuing our progress, we perceived a district with vegetables that
      grew not upon any soil but in the air. (*10) There were others that sprang
      from the substance of other vegetables; (*11) others that derived their
      substance from the bodies of living animals; (*12) and then again, there
      were others that glowed all over with intense fire; (*13) others that
      moved from place to place at pleasure, (*14) and what was still more
      wonderful, we discovered flowers that lived and breathed and moved their
      limbs at will and had, moreover, the detestable passion of mankind for
      enslaving other creatures, and confining them in horrid and solitary
      prisons until the fulfillment of appointed tasks.’” (*15)
    &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
      “Pshaw!” said the king.
    &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
      “‘Quitting this land, we soon arrived at another in which the bees and the
      birds are mathematicians of such genius and erudition, that they give
      daily instructions in the science of geometry to the wise men of the
      empire. The king of the place having offered a reward for the solution of
      two very difficult problems, they were solved upon the spot—the one
      by the bees, and the other by the birds; but the king keeping their
      solution a secret, it was only after the most profound researches and
      labor, and the writing of an infinity of big books, during a long series
      of years, that the men-mathematicians at length arrived at the identical
      solutions which had been given upon the spot by the bees and by the
      birds.’” (*16)
    &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
      “Oh my!” said the king.
    &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
      “‘We had scarcely lost sight of this empire when we found ourselves close
      upon another, from whose shores there flew over our heads a flock of fowls
      a mile in breadth, and two hundred and forty miles long; so that, although
      they flew a mile during every minute, it required no less than four hours
      for the whole flock to pass over us—in which there were several
      millions of millions of fowl.’” (*17)
    &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
      “Oh fy!” said the king.
    &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
      “‘No sooner had we got rid of these birds, which occasioned us great
      annoyance, than we were terrified by the appearance of a fowl of another
      kind, and infinitely larger than even the rocs which I met in my former
      voyages; for it was bigger than the biggest of the domes on your seraglio,
      oh, most Munificent of Caliphs. This terrible fowl had no head that we
      could perceive, but was fashioned entirely of belly, which was of a
      prodigious fatness and roundness, of a soft-looking substance, smooth,
      shining and striped with various colors. In its talons, the monster was
      bearing away to his eyrie in the heavens, a house from which it had
      knocked off the roof, and in the interior of which we distinctly saw human
      beings, who, beyond doubt, were in a state of frightful despair at the
      horrible fate which awaited them. We shouted with all our might, in the
      hope of frightening the bird into letting go of its prey, but it merely
      gave a snort or puff, as if of rage and then let fall upon our heads a
      heavy sack which proved to be filled with sand!’”
     &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
      “Stuff!” said the king.
    &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
      “‘It was just after this adventure that we encountered a continent of
      immense extent and prodigious solidity, but which, nevertheless, was
      supported entirely upon the back of a sky-blue cow that had no fewer than
      four hundred horns.’” (*18)
    &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
      “That, now, I believe,” said the king, “because I have read something of
      the kind before, in a book.”
     &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
      “‘We passed immediately beneath this continent, (swimming in between the
      legs of the cow), and, after some hours, found ourselves in a wonderful
      country indeed, which, I was informed by the man-animal, was his own
      native land, inhabited by things of his own species. This elevated the
      man-animal very much in my esteem, and in fact, I now began to feel
      ashamed of the contemptuous familiarity with which I had treated him; for
      I found that the man-animals in general were a nation of the most powerful
      magicians, who lived with worms in their brain, (*19) which, no doubt,
      served to stimulate them by their painful writhings and wrigglings to the
      most miraculous efforts of imagination!’”
     &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
      “Nonsense!” said the king.
    &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
      “‘Among the magicians, were domesticated several animals of very singular
      kinds; for example, there was a huge horse whose bones were iron and whose
      blood was boiling water. In place of corn, he had black stones for his
      usual food; and yet, in spite of so hard a diet, he was so strong and
      swift that he would drag a load more weighty than the grandest temple in
      this city, at a rate surpassing that of the flight of most birds.’” (*20)
    &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
      “Twattle!” said the king.
    &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
      “‘I saw, also, among these people a hen without feathers, but bigger than
      a camel; instead of flesh and bone she had iron and brick; her blood, like
      that of the horse, (to whom, in fact, she was nearly related,) was boiling
      water; and like him she ate nothing but wood or black stones. This hen
      brought forth very frequently, a hundred chickens in the day; and, after
      birth, they took up their residence for several weeks within the stomach
      of their mother.’” (*21)
    &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
      “Fal lal!” said the king.
    &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
      “‘One of this nation of mighty conjurors created a man out of brass and
      wood, and leather, and endowed him with such ingenuity that he would have
      beaten at chess, all the race of mankind with the exception of the great
      Caliph, Haroun Alraschid. (*22) Another of these magi constructed (of like
      material) a creature that put to shame even the genius of him who made it;
      for so great were its reasoning powers that, in a second, it performed
      calculations of so vast an extent that they would have required the united
      labor of fifty thousand fleshy men for a year. (*23) But a still more
      wonderful conjuror fashioned for himself a mighty thing that was neither
      man nor beast, but which had brains of lead, intermixed with a black
      matter like pitch, and fingers that it employed with such incredible speed
      and dexterity that it would have had no trouble in writing out twenty
      thousand copies of the Koran in an hour, and this with so exquisite a
      precision, that in all the copies there should not be found one to vary
      from another by the breadth of the finest hair. This thing was of
      prodigious strength, so that it erected or overthrew the mightiest empires
      at a breath; but its powers were exercised equally for evil and for
      good.’”
     &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
      “Ridiculous!” said the king.
    &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
      “‘Among this nation of necromancers there was also one who had in his
      veins the blood of the salamanders; for he made no scruple of sitting down
      to smoke his chibouc in a red-hot oven until his dinner was thoroughly
      roasted upon its floor. (*24) Another had the faculty of converting the
      common metals into gold, without even looking at them during the process.
      (*25) Another had such a delicacy of touch that he made a wire so fine as
      to be invisible. (*26) Another had such quickness of perception that he
      counted all the separate motions of an elastic body, while it was
      springing backward and forward at the rate of nine hundred millions of
      times in a second.’” (*27)
    &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
      “Absurd!” said the king.
    &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
      “‘Another of these magicians, by means of a fluid that nobody ever yet
      saw, could make the corpses of his friends brandish their arms, kick out
      their legs, fight, or even get up and dance at his will. (*28) Another had
      cultivated his voice to so great an extent that he could have made himself
      heard from one end of the world to the other. (*29) Another had so long an
      arm that he could sit down in Damascus and indite a letter at Bagdad—or
      indeed at any distance whatsoever. (*30) Another commanded the lightning
      to come down to him out of the heavens, and it came at his call; and
      served him for a plaything when it came. Another took two loud sounds and
      out of them made a silence. Another constructed a deep darkness out of two
      brilliant lights. (*31) Another made ice in a red-hot furnace. (*32)
      Another directed the sun to paint his portrait, and the sun did. (*33)
      Another took this luminary with the moon and the planets, and having first
      weighed them with scrupulous accuracy, probed into their depths and found
      out the solidity of the substance of which they were made. But the whole
      nation is, indeed, of so surprising a necromantic ability, that not even
      their infants, nor their commonest cats and dogs have any difficulty in
      seeing objects that do not exist at all, or that for twenty millions of
      years before the birth of the nation itself had been blotted out from the
      face of creation.’” (*34)
    &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
      “Preposterous!” said the king.
    &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
      “‘The wives and daughters of these incomparably great and wise magi,’”
       continued Scheherazade, without being in any manner disturbed by these
      frequent and most ungentlemanly interruptions on the part of her husband—“‘the
      wives and daughters of these eminent conjurers are every thing that is
      accomplished and refined; and would be every thing that is interesting and
      beautiful, but for an unhappy fatality that besets them, and from which
      not even the miraculous powers of their husbands and fathers has,
      hitherto, been adequate to save. Some fatalities come in certain shapes,
      and some in others—but this of which I speak has come in the shape
      of a crotchet.’”
     &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
      “A what?” said the king.
    &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
      “‘A crotchet’” said Scheherazade. “‘One of the evil genii, who are
      perpetually upon the watch to inflict ill, has put it into the heads of
      these accomplished ladies that the thing which we describe as personal
      beauty consists altogether in the protuberance of the region which lies
      not very far below the small of the back. Perfection of loveliness, they
      say, is in the direct ratio of the extent of this lump. Having been long
      possessed of this idea, and bolsters being cheap in that country, the days
      have long gone by since it was possible to distinguish a woman from a
      dromedary—’”
     &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
      “Stop!” said the king—“I can’t stand that, and I won’t. You have
      already given me a dreadful headache with your lies. The day, too, I
      perceive, is beginning to break. How long have we been married?—my
      conscience is getting to be troublesome again. And then that dromedary
      touch—do you take me for a fool? Upon the whole, you might as well
      get up and be throttled.”
     &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
      These words, as I learn from the “Isitsöornot,” both grieved and
      astonished Scheherazade; but, as she knew the king to be a man of
      scrupulous integrity, and quite unlikely to forfeit his word, she
      submitted to her fate with a good grace. She derived, however, great
      consolation, (during the tightening of the bowstring,) from the reflection
      that much of the history remained still untold, and that the petulance of
      her brute of a husband had reaped for him a most righteous reward, in
      depriving him of many inconceivable adventures.

  The ways of God in Nature, as in Providence, are not as our
  ways;  nor are the models that we frame any way commensurate to the
  vastness, profundity, and unsearchableness of His works, &lt;i&gt;which have

—&lt;i&gt;Joseph Glanville&lt;/i&gt;.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
      We had now reached the summit of the loftiest crag. For some minutes the
      old man seemed too much exhausted to speak.
    &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
      “Not long ago,” said he at length, “and I could have guided you on this
      route as well as the youngest of my sons; but, about three years past,
      there happened to me an event such as never happened to mortal man—or
      at least such as no man ever survived to tell of—and the six hours
      of deadly terror which I then endured have broken me up body and soul. You
      suppose me a &lt;i&gt;very&lt;/i&gt; old man—but I am not. It took less than a
      single day to change these hairs from a jetty black to white, to weaken my
      limbs, and to unstring my nerves, so that I tremble at the least exertion,
      and am frightened at a shadow. Do you know I can scarcely look over this
      little cliff without getting giddy?”
     &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
      The “little cliff,” upon whose edge he had so carelessly thrown himself
      down to rest that the weightier portion of his body hung over it, while he
      was only kept from falling by the tenure of his elbow on its extreme and
      slippery edge—this “little cliff” arose, a sheer unobstructed
      precipice of black shining rock, some fifteen or sixteen hundred feet from
      the world of crags beneath us. Nothing would have tempted me to within
      half a dozen yards of its brink. In truth so deeply was I excited by the
      perilous position of my companion, that I fell at full length upon the
      ground, clung to the shrubs around me, and dared not even glance upward at
      the sky—while I struggled in vain to divest myself of the idea that
      the very foundations of the mountain were in danger from the fury of the
      winds. It was long before I could reason myself into sufficient courage to
      sit up and look out into the distance.
    &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
      “You must get over these fancies,” said the guide, “for I have brought you
      here that you might have the best possible view of the scene of that event
      I mentioned—and to tell you the whole story with the spot just under
      your eye.”
     &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
      “We are now,” he continued, in that particularizing manner which
      distinguished him—“we are now close upon the Norwegian coast—in
      the sixty-eighth degree of latitude—in the great province of
      Nordland—and in the dreary district of Lofoden. The mountain upon
      whose top we sit is Helseggen, the Cloudy. Now raise yourself up a little
      higher—hold on to the grass if you feel giddy—so—and
      look out, beyond the belt of vapor beneath us, into the sea.”
     &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
      I looked dizzily, and beheld a wide expanse of ocean, whose waters wore so
      inky a hue as to bring at once to my mind the Nubian geographer’s account
      of the &lt;i&gt;Mare Tenebrarum&lt;/i&gt;. A panorama more deplorably desolate no
      human imagination can conceive. To the right and left, as far as the eye
      could reach, there lay outstretched, like ramparts of the world, lines of
      horridly black and beetling cliff, whose character of gloom was but the
      more forcibly illustrated by the surf which reared high up against its
      white and ghastly crest, howling and shrieking forever. Just opposite the
      promontory upon whose apex we were placed, and at a distance of some five
      or six miles out at sea, there was visible a small, bleak-looking island;
      or, more properly, its position was discernible through the wilderness of
      surge in which it was enveloped. About two miles nearer the land, arose
      another of smaller size, hideously craggy and barren, and encompassed at
      various intervals by a cluster of dark rocks.
    &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
      The appearance of the ocean, in the space between the more distant island
      and the shore, had something very unusual about it. Although, at the time,
      so strong a gale was blowing landward that a brig in the remote offing lay
      to under a double-reefed trysail, and constantly plunged her whole hull
      out of sight, still there was here nothing like a regular swell, but only
      a short, quick, angry cross dashing of water in every direction—as
      well in the teeth of the wind as otherwise. Of foam there was little
      except in the immediate vicinity of the rocks.
    &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
      “The island in the distance,” resumed the old man, “is called by the
      Norwegians Vurrgh. The one midway is Moskoe. That a mile to the northward
      is Ambaaren. Yonder are Islesen, Hotholm, Keildhelm, Suarven, and
      Buckholm. Farther off—between Moskoe and Vurrgh—are Otterholm,
      Flimen, Sandflesen, and Stockholm. These are the true names of the places—but
      why it has been thought necessary to name them at all, is more than either
      you or I can understand. Do you hear anything? Do you see any change in
      the water?”
     &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
      We had now been about ten minutes upon the top of Helseggen, to which we
      had ascended from the interior of Lofoden, so that we had caught no
      glimpse of the sea until it had burst upon us from the summit. As the old
      man spoke, I became aware of a loud and gradually increasing sound, like
      the moaning of a vast herd of buffaloes upon an American prairie; and at
      the same moment I perceived that what seamen term the &lt;i&gt;chopping&lt;/i&gt;
      character of the ocean beneath us, was rapidly changing into a current
      which set to the eastward. Even while I gazed, this current acquired a
      monstrous velocity. Each moment added to its speed—to its headlong
      impetuosity. In five minutes the whole sea, as far as Vurrgh, was lashed
      into ungovernable fury; but it was between Moskoe and the coast that the
      main uproar held its sway. Here the vast bed of the waters, seamed and
      scarred into a thousand conflicting channels, burst suddenly into
      phrensied convulsion—heaving, boiling, hissing—gyrating in
      gigantic and innumerable vortices, and all whirling and plunging on to the
      eastward with a rapidity which water never elsewhere assumes except in
      precipitous descents.
    &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
      In a few minutes more, there came over the scene another radical
      alteration. The general surface grew somewhat more smooth, and the
      whirlpools, one by one, disappeared, while prodigious streaks of foam
      became apparent where none had been seen before. These streaks, at length,
      spreading out to a great distance, and entering into combination, took
      unto themselves the gyratory motion of the subsided vortices, and seemed
      to form the germ of another more vast. Suddenly—very suddenly—this
      assumed a distinct and definite existence, in a circle of more than a mile
      in diameter. The edge of the whirl was represented by a broad belt of
      gleaming spray; but no particle of this slipped into the mouth of the
      terrific funnel, whose interior, as far as the eye could fathom it, was a
      smooth, shining, and jet-black wall of water, inclined to the horizon at
      an angle of some forty-five degrees, speeding dizzily round and round with
      a swaying and sweltering motion, and sending forth to the winds an
      appalling voice, half shriek, half roar, such as not even the mighty
      cataract of Niagara ever lifts up in its agony to Heaven.
    &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
      The mountain trembled to its very base, and the rock rocked. I threw
      myself upon my face, and clung to the scant herbage in an excess of
      nervous agitation.
    &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
      “This,” said I at length, to the old man—“this &lt;i&gt;can&lt;/i&gt; be nothing
      else than the great whirlpool of the Maelström.”
     &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
      “So it is sometimes termed,” said he. “We Norwegians call it the
      Moskoe-ström, from the island of Moskoe in the midway.”
     &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
      The ordinary accounts of this vortex had by no means prepared me for what
      I saw. That of Jonas Ramus, which is perhaps the most circumstantial of
      any, cannot impart the faintest conception either of the magnificence, or
      of the horror of the scene—or of the wild bewildering sense of &lt;i&gt;the
      novel&lt;/i&gt; which confounds the beholder. I am not sure from what point of
      view the writer in question surveyed it, nor at what time; but it could
      neither have been from the summit of Helseggen, nor during a storm. There
      are some passages of his description, nevertheless, which may be quoted
      for their details, although their effect is exceedingly feeble in
      conveying an impression of the spectacle.
    &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
      “Between Lofoden and Moskoe,” he says, “the depth of the water is between
      thirty-six and forty fathoms; but on the other side, toward Ver (Vurrgh)
      this depth decreases so as not to afford a convenient passage for a
      vessel, without the risk of splitting on the rocks, which happens even in
      the calmest weather. When it is flood, the stream runs up the country
      between Lofoden and Moskoe with a boisterous rapidity; but the roar of its
      impetuous ebb to the sea is scarce equalled by the loudest and most
      dreadful cataracts; the noise being heard several leagues off, and the
      vortices or pits are of such an extent and depth, that if a ship comes
      within its attraction, it is inevitably absorbed and carried down to the
      bottom, and there beat to pieces against the rocks; and when the water
      relaxes, the fragments thereof are thrown up again. But these intervals of
      tranquility are only at the turn of the ebb and flood, and in calm
      weather, and last but a quarter of an hour, its violence gradually
      returning. When the stream is most boisterous, and its fury heightened by
      a storm, it is dangerous to come within a Norway mile of it. Boats,
      yachts, and ships have been carried away by not guarding against it before
      they were within its reach. It likewise happens frequently, that whales
      come too near the stream, and are overpowered by its violence; and then it
      is impossible to describe their howlings and bellowings in their fruitless
      struggles to disengage themselves. A bear once, attempting to swim from
      Lofoden to Moskoe, was caught by the stream and borne down, while he
      roared terribly, so as to be heard on shore. Large stocks of firs and pine
      trees, after being absorbed by the current, rise again broken and torn to
      such a degree as if bristles grew upon them. This plainly shows the bottom
      to consist of craggy rocks, among which they are whirled to and fro. This
      stream is regulated by the flux and reflux of the sea—it being
      constantly high and low water every six hours. In the year 1645, early in
      the morning of Sexagesima Sunday, it raged with such noise and impetuosity
      that the very stones of the houses on the coast fell to the ground.”
     &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
      In regard to the depth of the water, I could not see how this could have
      been ascertained at all in the immediate vicinity of the vortex. The
      “forty fathoms” must have reference only to portions of the channel close
      upon the shore either of Moskoe or Lofoden. The depth in the centre of the
      Moskoe-ström must be immeasurably greater; and no better proof of this
      fact is necessary than can be obtained from even the sidelong glance into
      the abyss of the whirl which may be had from the highest crag of
      Helseggen. Looking down from this pinnacle upon the howling Phlegethon
      below, I could not help smiling at the simplicity with which the honest
      Jonas Ramus records, as a matter difficult of belief, the anecdotes of the
      whales and the bears; for it appeared to me, in fact, a self-evident
      thing, that the largest ship of the line in existence, coming within the
      influence of that deadly attraction, could resist it as little as a
      feather the hurricane, and must disappear bodily and at once.
    &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
      The attempts to account for the phenomenon—some of which, I
      remember, seemed to me sufficiently plausible in perusal—now wore a
      very different and unsatisfactory aspect. The idea generally received is
      that this, as well as three smaller vortices among the Ferroe islands,
      “have no other cause than the collision of waves rising and falling, at
      flux and reflux, against a ridge of rocks and shelves, which confines the
      water so that it precipitates itself like a cataract; and thus the higher
      the flood rises, the deeper must the fall be, and the natural result of
      all is a whirlpool or vortex, the prodigious suction of which is
      sufficiently known by lesser experiments.”—These are the words of
      the Encyclopædia Britannica. Kircher and others imagine that in the centre
      of the channel of the Maelström is an abyss penetrating the globe, and
      issuing in some very remote part—the Gulf of Bothnia being somewhat
      decidedly named in one instance. This opinion, idle in itself, was the one
      to which, as I gazed, my imagination most readily assented; and,
      mentioning it to the guide, I was rather surprised to hear him say that,
      although it was the view almost universally entertained of the subject by
      the Norwegians, it nevertheless was not his own. As to the former notion
      he confessed his inability to comprehend it; and here I agreed with him—for,
      however conclusive on paper, it becomes altogether unintelligible, and
      even absurd, amid the thunder of the abyss.
    &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
      “You have had a good look at the whirl now,” said the old man, “and if you
      will creep round this crag, so as to get in its lee, and deaden the roar
      of the water, I will tell you a story that will convince you I ought to
      know something of the Moskoe-ström.”
     &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
      I placed myself as desired, and he proceeded.
    &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
      “Myself and my two brothers once owned a schooner-rigged smack of about
      seventy tons burthen, with which we were in the habit of fishing among the
      islands beyond Moskoe, nearly to Vurrgh. In all violent eddies at sea
      there is good fishing, at proper opportunities, if one has only the
      courage to attempt it; but among the whole of the Lofoden coastmen, we
      three were the only ones who made a regular business of going out to the
      islands, as I tell you. The usual grounds are a great way lower down to
      the southward. There fish can be got at all hours, without much risk, and
      therefore these places are preferred. The choice spots over here among the
      rocks, however, not only yield the finest variety, but in far greater
      abundance; so that we often got in a single day, what the more timid of
      the craft could not scrape together in a week. In fact, we made it a
      matter of desperate speculation—the risk of life standing instead of
      labor, and courage answering for capital.
    &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
      “We kept the smack in a cove about five miles higher up the coast than
      this; and it was our practice, in fine weather, to take advantage of the
      fifteen minutes’ slack to push across the main channel of the
      Moskoe-ström, far above the pool, and then drop down upon anchorage
      somewhere near Otterholm, or Sandflesen, where the eddies are not so
      violent as elsewhere. Here we used to remain until nearly time for
      slack-water again, when we weighed and made for home. We never set out
      upon this expedition without a steady side wind for going and coming—one
      that we felt sure would not fail us before our return—and we seldom
      made a mis-calculation upon this point. Twice, during six years, we were
      forced to stay all night at anchor on account of a dead calm, which is a
      rare thing indeed just about here; and once we had to remain on the
      grounds nearly a week, starving to death, owing to a gale which blew up
      shortly after our arrival, and made the channel too boisterous to be
      thought of. Upon this occasion we should have been driven out to sea in
      spite of everything, (for the whirlpools threw us round and round so
      violently, that, at length, we fouled our anchor and dragged it) if it had
      not been that we drifted into one of the innumerable cross currents—here
      to-day and gone to-morrow—which drove us under the lee of Flimen,
      where, by good luck, we brought up.
    &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
      “I could not tell you the twentieth part of the difficulties we
      encountered ‘on the grounds’—it is a bad spot to be in, even in good
      weather—but we made shift always to run the gauntlet of the
      Moskoe-ström itself without accident; although at times my heart has been
      in my mouth when we happened to be a minute or so behind or before the
      slack. The wind sometimes was not as strong as we thought it at starting,
      and then we made rather less way than we could wish, while the current
      rendered the smack unmanageable. My eldest brother had a son eighteen
      years old, and I had two stout boys of my own. These would have been of
      great assistance at such times, in using the sweeps, as well as afterward
      in fishing—but, somehow, although we ran the risk ourselves, we had
      not the heart to let the young ones get into the danger—for, after
      all is said and done, it &lt;i&gt;was&lt;/i&gt; a horrible danger, and that is the
      truth.
    &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
      “It is now within a few days of three years since what I am going to tell
      you occurred. It was on the tenth day of July, 18—, a day which the people
      of this part of the world will never forget—for it was one in which
      blew the most terrible hurricane that ever came out of the heavens. And
      yet all the morning, and indeed until late in the afternoon, there was a
      gentle and steady breeze from the south-west, while the sun shone
      brightly, so that the oldest seaman among us could not have foreseen what
      was to follow.
    &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
      “The three of us—my two brothers and myself—had crossed over
      to the islands about two o’clock P. M., and had soon nearly loaded the
      smack with fine fish, which, we all remarked, were more plenty that day
      than we had ever known them. It was just seven, &lt;i&gt;by my watch&lt;/i&gt;, when
      we weighed and started for home, so as to make the worst of the Ström at
      slack water, which we knew would be at eight.
    &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
      “We set out with a fresh wind on our starboard quarter, and for some time
      spanked along at a great rate, never dreaming of danger, for indeed we saw
      not the slightest reason to apprehend it. All at once we were taken aback
      by a breeze from over Helseggen. This was most unusual—something
      that had never happened to us before—and I began to feel a little
      uneasy, without exactly knowing why. We put the boat on the wind, but
      could make no headway at all for the eddies, and I was upon the point of
      proposing to return to the anchorage, when, looking astern, we saw the
      whole horizon covered with a singular copper-colored cloud that rose with
      the most amazing velocity.
    &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
      “In the meantime the breeze that had headed us off fell away, and we were
      dead becalmed, drifting about in every direction. This state of things,
      however, did not last long enough to give us time to think about it. In
      less than a minute the storm was upon us—in less than two the sky
      was entirely overcast—and what with this and the driving spray, it
      became suddenly so dark that we could not see each other in the smack.
    &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
      “Such a hurricane as then blew it is folly to attempt describing. The
      oldest seaman in Norway never experienced any thing like it. We had let
      our sails go by the run before it cleverly took us; but, at the first
      puff, both our masts went by the board as if they had been sawed off—the
      mainmast taking with it my youngest brother, who had lashed himself to it
      for safety.
    &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
      “Our boat was the lightest feather of a thing that ever sat upon water. It
      had a complete flush deck, with only a small hatch near the bow, and this
      hatch it had always been our custom to batten down when about to cross the
      Ström, by way of precaution against the chopping seas. But for this
      circumstance we should have foundered at once—for we lay entirely
      buried for some moments. How my elder brother escaped destruction I cannot
      say, for I never had an opportunity of ascertaining. For my part, as soon
      as I had let the foresail run, I threw myself flat on deck, with my feet
      against the narrow gunwale of the bow, and with my hands grasping a
      ring-bolt near the foot of the fore-mast. It was mere instinct that
      prompted me to do this—which was undoubtedly the very best thing I
      could have done—for I was too much flurried to think.
    &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
      “For some moments we were completely deluged, as I say, and all this time
      I held my breath, and clung to the bolt. When I could stand it no longer I
      raised myself upon my knees, still keeping hold with my hands, and thus
      got my head clear. Presently our little boat gave herself a shake, just as
      a dog does in coming out of the water, and thus rid herself, in some
      measure, of the seas. I was now trying to get the better of the stupor
      that had come over me, and to collect my senses so as to see what was to
      be done, when I felt somebody grasp my arm. It was my elder brother, and
      my heart leaped for joy, for I had made sure that he was overboard—but
      the next moment all this joy was turned into horror—for he put his
      mouth close to my ear, and screamed out the word ‘&lt;i&gt;Moskoe-ström!&lt;/i&gt;’ 
    &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
      “No one ever will know what my feelings were at that moment. I shook from
      head to foot as if I had had the most violent fit of the ague. I knew what
      he meant by that one word well enough—I knew what he wished to make
      me understand. With the wind that now drove us on, we were bound for the
      whirl of the Ström, and nothing could save us!
    &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
      “You perceive that in crossing the Ström &lt;i&gt;channel&lt;/i&gt;, we always went a
      long way up above the whirl, even in the calmest weather, and then had to
      wait and watch carefully for the slack—but now we were driving right
      upon the pool itself, and in such a hurricane as this! ‘To be sure,’ I
      thought, ‘we shall get there just about the slack—there is some
      little hope in that’—but in the next moment I cursed myself for
      being so great a fool as to dream of hope at all. I knew very well that we
      were doomed, had we been ten times a ninety-gun ship.
    &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
      “By this time the first fury of the tempest had spent itself, or perhaps
      we did not feel it so much, as we scudded before it, but at all events the
      seas, which at first had been kept down by the wind, and lay flat and
      frothing, now got up into absolute mountains. A singular change, too, had
      come over the heavens. Around in every direction it was still as black as
      pitch, but nearly overhead there burst out, all at once, a circular rift
      of clear sky—as clear as I ever saw—and of a deep bright blue—and
      through it there blazed forth the full moon with a lustre that I never
      before knew her to wear. She lit up every thing about us with the greatest
      distinctness—but, oh God, what a scene it was to light up!
    &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
      “I now made one or two attempts to speak to my brother—but, in some
      manner which I could not understand, the din had so increased that I could
      not make him hear a single word, although I screamed at the top of my
      voice in his ear. Presently he shook his head, looking as pale as death,
      and held up one of his fingers, as if to say &lt;i&gt;‘listen! ‘&lt;/i&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
      “At first I could not make out what he meant—but soon a hideous
      thought flashed upon me. I dragged my watch from its fob. It was not
      going. I glanced at its face by the moonlight, and then burst into tears
      as I flung it far away into the ocean. &lt;i&gt;It had run down at seven
      o’clock! We were behind the time of the slack, and the whirl of the Ström
      was in full fury!&lt;/i&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
      “When a boat is well built, properly trimmed, and not deep laden, the
      waves in a strong gale, when she is going large, seem always to slip from
      beneath her—which appears very strange to a landsman—and this
      is what is called &lt;i&gt;riding&lt;/i&gt;, in sea phrase.
    &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
      “Well, so far we had ridden the swells very cleverly; but presently
      a gigantic sea happened to take us right under the counter, and bore us
      with it as it rose—up—up—as if into the sky. I would
      not have believed that any wave could rise so high. And then down we came
      with a sweep, a slide, and a plunge, that made me feel sick and dizzy, as
      if I was falling from some lofty mountain-top in a dream. But while we
      were up I had thrown a quick glance around—and that one glance was
      all sufficient. I saw our exact position in an instant. The Moskoe-Ström
      whirlpool was about a quarter of a mile dead ahead—but no more like
      the every-day Moskoe-Ström than the whirl as you now see it, is like a
      mill-race. If I had not known where we were, and what we had to expect, I
      should not have recognised the place at all. As it was, I involuntarily
      closed my eyes in horror. The lids clenched themselves together as if in
      a spasm.
    &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
      “It could not have been more than two minutes afterward until we suddenly
      felt the waves subside, and were enveloped in foam. The boat made a sharp
      half turn to larboard, and then shot off in its new direction like a
      thunderbolt. At the same moment the roaring noise of the water was
      completely drowned in a kind of shrill shriek—such a sound as you
      might imagine given out by the waste-pipes of many thousand steam-vessels,
      letting off their steam all together. We were now in the belt of surf that
      always surrounds the whirl; and I thought, of course, that another moment
      would plunge us into the abyss, down which we could only see
      indistinctly on account of the amazing velocity with which we wore borne
      along. The boat did not seem to sink into the water at all, but to skim
      like an air-bubble upon the surface of the surge. Her starboard side was
      next the whirl, and on the larboard arose the world of ocean we had left.
      It stood like a huge writhing wall between us and the horizon.
    &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
      “It may appear strange, but now, when we were in the very jaws of the
      gulf, I felt more composed than when we were only approaching it. Having
      made up my mind to hope no more, I got rid of a great deal of that terror
      which unmanned me at first. I suppose it was despair that strung my
      nerves.
    &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
      “It may look like boasting—but what I tell you is truth—I
      began to reflect how magnificent a thing it was to die in such a manner,
      and how foolish it was in me to think of so paltry a consideration as my
      own individual life, in view of so wonderful a manifestation of God’s
      power. I do believe that I blushed with shame when this idea crossed my
      mind. After a little while I became possessed with the keenest curiosity
      about the whirl itself. I positively felt a &lt;i&gt;wish&lt;/i&gt; to explore its
      depths, even at the sacrifice I was going to make; and my principal grief
      was that I should never be able to tell my old companions on shore about
      the mysteries I should see. These, no doubt, were singular fancies to
      occupy a man’s mind in such extremity—and I have often thought
      since, that the revolutions of the boat around the pool might have
      rendered me a little light-headed.
    &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
      “There was another circumstance which tended to restore my
      self-possession; and this was the cessation of the wind, which could not
      reach us in our present situation—for, as you saw yourself, the belt
      of surf is considerably lower than the general bed of the ocean, and this
      latter now towered above us, a high, black, mountainous ridge. If you have
      never been at sea in a heavy gale, you can form no idea of the confusion
      of mind occasioned by the wind and spray together. They blind, deafen, and
      strangle you, and take away all power of action or reflection. But we were
      now, in a great measure, rid of these annoyances—just as
      death-condemned felons in prison are allowed petty indulgences, forbidden
      them while their doom is yet uncertain.
    &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
      “How often we made the circuit of the belt it is impossible to say. We
      careered round and round for perhaps an hour, flying rather than floating,
      getting gradually more and more into the middle of the surge, and then
      nearer and nearer to its horrible inner edge. All this time I had never
      let go of the ring-bolt. My brother was at the stern, holding on to a
      small empty water-cask which had been securely lashed under the coop of
      the counter, and was the only thing on deck that had not been swept
      overboard when the gale first took us. As we approached the brink of the
      pit he let go his hold upon this, and made for the ring, from which, in
      the agony of his terror, he endeavored to force my hands, as it was not
      large enough to afford us both a secure grasp. I never felt deeper grief
      than when I saw him attempt this act—although I knew he was a madman
      when he did it—a raving maniac through sheer fright. I did not care,
      however, to contest the point with him. I knew it could make no difference
      whether either of us held on at all; so I let him have the bolt, and went
      astern to the cask. This there was no great difficulty in doing; for the
      smack flew round steadily enough, and upon an even keel—only swaying
      to and fro, with the immense sweeps and swelters of the whirl. Scarcely
      had I secured myself in my new position, when we gave a wild lurch to
      starboard, and rushed headlong into the abyss. I muttered a hurried prayer
      to God, and thought all was over.
    &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
      “As I felt the sickening sweep of the descent, I had instinctively
      tightened my hold upon the barrel, and closed my eyes. For some seconds I
      dared not open them—while I expected instant destruction, and
      wondered that I was not already in my death-struggles with the water. But
      moment after moment elapsed. I still lived. The sense of falling had
      ceased; and the motion of the vessel seemed much as it had been before,
      while in the belt of foam, with the exception that she now lay more along.
      I took courage, and looked once again upon the scene.
    &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
      “Never shall I forget the sensations of awe, horror, and admiration with
      which I gazed about me. The boat appeared to be hanging, as if by magic,
      midway down, upon the interior surface of a funnel vast in circumference,
      prodigious in depth, and whose perfectly smooth sides might have been
      mistaken for ebony, but for the bewildering rapidity with which they spun
      around, and for the gleaming and ghastly radiance they shot forth, as the
      rays of the full moon, from that circular rift amid the clouds which I
      have already described, streamed in a flood of golden glory along the
      black walls, and far away down into the inmost recesses of the abyss.
    &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
      “At first I was too much confused to observe anything accurately. The
      general burst of terrific grandeur was all that I beheld. When I recovered
      myself a little, however, my gaze fell instinctively downward. In this
      direction I was able to obtain an unobstructed view, from the manner in
      which the smack hung on the inclined surface of the pool. She was quite
      upon an even keel—that is to say, her deck lay in a plane parallel
      with that of the water—but this latter sloped at an angle of more
      than forty-five degrees, so that we seemed to be lying upon our beam-ends.
      I could not help observing, nevertheless, that I had scarcely more
      difficulty in maintaining my hold and footing in this situation, than if
      we had been upon a dead level; and this, I suppose, was owing to the speed
      at which we revolved.
    &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
      “The rays of the moon seemed to search the very bottom of the profound
      gulf; but still I could make out nothing distinctly, on account of a thick
      mist in which everything there was enveloped, and over which there hung a
      magnificent rainbow, like that narrow and tottering bridge which Mussulmen
      say is the only pathway between Time and Eternity. This mist, or spray,
      was no doubt occasioned by the clashing of the great walls of the funnel,
      as they all met together at the bottom—but the yell that went up to
      the Heavens from out of that mist, I dare not attempt to describe.
    &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
      “Our first slide into the abyss itself, from the belt of foam above, had
      carried us a great distance down the slope; but our farther descent was by
      no means proportionate. Round and round we swept—not with any
      uniform movement—but in dizzying swings and jerks, that sent us
      sometimes only a few hundred yards—sometimes nearly the complete
      circuit of the whirl. Our progress downward, at each revolution, was slow,
      but very perceptible.
    &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
      “Looking about me upon the wide waste of liquid ebony on which we were
      thus borne, I perceived that our boat was not the only object in the
      embrace of the whirl. Both above and below us were visible fragments of
      vessels, large masses of building timber and trunks of trees, with many
      smaller articles, such as pieces of house furniture, broken boxes, barrels
      and staves. I have already described the unnatural curiosity which had
      taken the place of my original terrors. It appeared to grow upon me as I
      drew nearer and nearer to my dreadful doom. I now began to watch, with a
      strange interest, the numerous things that floated in our company. I &lt;i&gt;must&lt;/i&gt;
      have been delirious, for I even sought &lt;i&gt;amusement&lt;/i&gt; in
      speculating upon the relative velocities of their several descents toward
      the foam below. ‘This fir tree,’ I found myself at one time saying, ‘will
      certainly be the next thing that takes the awful plunge and disappears,’—and
      then I was disappointed to find that the wreck of a Dutch merchant ship
      overtook it and went down before. At length, after making several guesses
      of this nature, and being deceived in all—this fact—the fact
      of my invariable miscalculation, set me upon a train of reflection
      that made my limbs again tremble, and my heart beat heavily once more.
    &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
      “It was not a new terror that thus affected me, but the dawn of a more
      exciting &lt;i&gt;hope&lt;/i&gt;. This hope arose partly from memory, and partly from
      present observation. I called to mind the great variety of buoyant matter
      that strewed the coast of Lofoden, having been absorbed and then thrown
      forth by the Moskoe-ström. By far the greater number of the articles were
      shattered in the most extraordinary way—so chafed and roughened as
      to have the appearance of being stuck full of splinters—but then I
      distinctly recollected that there were &lt;i&gt;some&lt;/i&gt; of them which were not
      disfigured at all. Now I could not account for this difference except by
      supposing that the roughened fragments were the only ones which had been
      &lt;i&gt;completely absorbed&lt;/i&gt;—that the others had entered the whirl at
      so late a period of the tide, or, for some reason, had descended so slowly
      after entering, that they did not reach the bottom before the turn of the
      flood came, or of the ebb, as the case might be. I conceived it possible,
      in either instance, that they might thus be whirled up again to the level
      of the ocean, without undergoing the fate of those which had been drawn in
      more early, or absorbed more rapidly. I made, also, three important
      observations. The first was, that, as a general rule, the larger the
      bodies were, the more rapid their descent—the second, that, between
      two masses of equal extent, the one spherical, and the other &lt;i&gt;of any
      other shape&lt;/i&gt;, the superiority in speed of descent was with the sphere—the
      third, that, between two masses of equal size, the one cylindrical, and
      the other of any other shape, the cylinder was absorbed the more slowly.
      Since my escape, I have had several conversations on this subject with an
      old school-master of the district; and it was from him that I learned the
      use of the words ‘cylinder’ and ‘sphere.’ He explained to me—although
      I have forgotten the explanation—how what I observed was, in fact,
      the natural consequence of the forms of the floating fragments—and
      showed me how it happened that a cylinder, swimming in a vortex, offered
      more resistance to its suction, and was drawn in with greater difficulty
      than an equally bulky body, of any form whatever. (*1)
    &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
      “There was one startling circumstance which went a great way in enforcing
      these observations, and rendering me anxious to turn them to account, and
      this was that, at every revolution, we passed something like a barrel, or
      else the yard or the mast of a vessel, while many of these things, which
      had been on our level when I first opened my eyes upon the wonders of the
      whirlpool, were now high up above us, and seemed to have moved but little
      from their original station.
    &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
      “I no longer hesitated what to do. I resolved to lash myself securely to
      the water cask upon which I now held, to cut it loose from the counter,
      and to throw myself with it into the water. I attracted my brother’s
      attention by signs, pointed to the floating barrels that came near us, and
      did everything in my power to make him understand what I was about to do.
      I thought at length that he comprehended my design—but, whether this
      was the case or not, he shook his head despairingly, and refused to move
      from his station by the ring-bolt. It was impossible to reach him; the
      emergency admitted of no delay; and so, with a bitter struggle, I resigned
      him to his fate, fastened myself to the cask by means of the lashings
      which secured it to the counter, and precipitated myself with it into the
      sea, without another moment’s hesitation.
    &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
      “The result was precisely what I had hoped it might be. As it is myself
      who now tell you this tale—as you see that I &lt;i&gt;did&lt;/i&gt; escape—and
      as you are already in possession of the mode in which this escape was
      effected, and must therefore anticipate all that I have farther to say—I
      will bring my story quickly to conclusion. It might have been an hour, or
      thereabout, after my quitting the smack, when, having descended to a vast
      distance beneath me, it made three or four wild gyrations in rapid
      succession, and, bearing my loved brother with it, plunged headlong, at
      once and forever, into the chaos of foam below. The barrel to which I was
      attached sunk very little farther than half the distance between the
      bottom of the gulf and the spot at which I leaped overboard, before a
      great change took place in the character of the whirlpool. The slope of
      the sides of the vast funnel became momently less and less steep. The
      gyrations of the whirl grew, gradually, less and less violent. By degrees,
      the froth and the rainbow disappeared, and the bottom of the gulf seemed
      slowly to uprise. The sky was clear, the winds had gone down, and the full
      moon was setting radiantly in the west, when I found myself on the surface
      of the ocean, in full view of the shores of Lofoden, and above the spot
      where the pool of the Moskoe-ström &lt;i&gt;had been&lt;/i&gt;. It was the hour of the
      slack—but the sea still heaved in mountainous waves from the effects
      of the hurricane. I was borne violently into the channel of the Ström, and
      in a few minutes was hurried down the coast into the ‘grounds’ of the
      fishermen. A boat picked me up—exhausted from fatigue—and (now
      that the danger was removed) speechless from the memory of its horror.
      Those who drew me on board were my old mates and daily companions—but
      they knew me no more than they would have known a traveller from the
      spirit-land. My hair which had been raven-black the day before, was as
      white as you see it now. They say too that the whole expression of my
      countenance had changed. I told them my story—they did not believe
      it. I now tell it to &lt;i&gt;you&lt;/i&gt;—and I can scarcely expect you to put
      more faith in it than did the merry fishermen of Lofoden.”

&lt;h2&gt;&lt;a id=&#34;chap2.4&#34;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;VON KEMPELEN AND HIS DISCOVERY&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
      After the very minute and elaborate paper by Arago, to say nothing of the
      summary in ‘Silliman’s Journal,’ with the detailed statement just
      published by Lieutenant Maury, it will not be supposed, of course, that in
      offering a few hurried remarks in reference to Von Kempelen’s discovery, I
      have any design to look at the subject in a scientific point of view. My
      object is simply, in the first place, to say a few words of Von Kempelen
      himself (with whom, some years ago, I had the honor of a slight personal
      acquaintance), since every thing which concerns him must necessarily, at
      this moment, be of interest; and, in the second place, to look in a
      general way, and speculatively, at the results of the discovery.
    &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
      It may be as well, however, to premise the cursory observations which I
      have to offer, by denying, very decidedly, what seems to be a general
      impression (gleaned, as usual in a case of this kind, from the
      newspapers), viz.: that this discovery, astounding as it unquestionably
      is, is unanticipated.
    &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
      By reference to the ‘Diary of Sir Humphrey Davy’ (Cottle and Munroe,
      London, pp. 150), it will be seen at pp. 53 and 82, that this illustrious
      chemist had not only conceived the idea now in question, but had actually
      made no inconsiderable progress, experimentally, in the very identical
      analysis now so triumphantly brought to an issue by Von Kempelen, who
      although he makes not the slightest allusion to it, is, without doubt (I
      say it unhesitatingly, and can prove it, if required), indebted to the
      ‘Diary’ for at least the first hint of his own undertaking.
    &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
      The paragraph from the ‘Courier and Enquirer,’ which is now going the
      rounds of the press, and which purports to claim the invention for a Mr.
      Kissam, of Brunswick, Maine, appears to me, I confess, a little
      apocryphal, for several reasons; although there is nothing either
      impossible or very improbable in the statement made. I need not go into
      details. My opinion of the paragraph is founded principally upon its
      manner. It does not look true. Persons who are narrating facts, are seldom
      so particular as Mr. Kissam seems to be, about day and date and precise
      location. Besides, if Mr. Kissam actually did come upon the discovery he
      says he did, at the period designated—nearly eight years ago—how
      happens it that he took no steps, on the instant, to reap the immense
      benefits which the merest bumpkin must have known would have resulted to
      him individually, if not to the world at large, from the discovery? It
      seems to me quite incredible that any man of common understanding could
      have discovered what Mr. Kissam says he did, and yet have subsequently
      acted so like a baby—so like an owl—as Mr. Kissam admits that
      he did. By-the-way, who is Mr. Kissam? and is not the whole paragraph in
      the ‘Courier and Enquirer’ a fabrication got up to ‘make a talk’? It must
      be confessed that it has an amazingly moon-hoaxy-air. Very little
      dependence is to be placed upon it, in my humble opinion; and if I were
      not well aware, from experience, how very easily men of science are
      mystified, on points out of their usual range of inquiry, I should be
      profoundly astonished at finding so eminent a chemist as Professor Draper,
      discussing Mr. Kissam’s (or is it Mr. Quizzem’s?) pretensions to the
      discovery, in so serious a tone.
    &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
      But to return to the ‘Diary’ of Sir Humphrey Davy. This pamphlet was not
      designed for the public eye, even upon the decease of the writer, as any
      person at all conversant with authorship may satisfy himself at once by
      the slightest inspection of the style. At page 13, for example, near the
      middle, we read, in reference to his researches about the protoxide of
      azote: ‘In less than half a minute the respiration being continued,
      diminished gradually and were succeeded by analogous to gentle pressure on
      all the muscles.’ That the respiration was not ‘diminished,’ is not only
      clear by the subsequent context, but by the use of the plural, ‘were.’ The
      sentence, no doubt, was thus intended: ‘In less than half a minute, the
      respiration [being continued, these feelings] diminished gradually, and
      were succeeded by [a sensation] analogous to gentle pressure on all the
      muscles.’ A hundred similar instances go to show that the MS. so
      inconsiderately published, was merely a rough note-book, meant only for
      the writer’s own eye, but an inspection of the pamphlet will convince
      almost any thinking person of the truth of my suggestion. The fact is, Sir
      Humphrey Davy was about the last man in the world to commit himself on
      scientific topics. Not only had he a more than ordinary dislike to
      quackery, but he was morbidly afraid of appearing empirical; so that,
      however fully he might have been convinced that he was on the right track
      in the matter now in question, he would never have spoken out, until he
      had every thing ready for the most practical demonstration. I verily
      believe that his last moments would have been rendered wretched, could he
      have suspected that his wishes in regard to burning this ‘Diary’ (full of
      crude speculations) would have been unattended to; as, it seems, they
      were. I say ‘his wishes,’ for that he meant to include this note-book
      among the miscellaneous papers directed ‘to be burnt,’ I think there can
      be no manner of doubt. Whether it escaped the flames by good fortune or by
      bad, yet remains to be seen. That the passages quoted above, with the
      other similar ones referred to, gave Von Kempelen the hint, I do not in
      the slightest degree question; but I repeat, it yet remains to be seen
      whether this momentous discovery itself (momentous under any
      circumstances) will be of service or disservice to mankind at large. That
      Von Kempelen and his immediate friends will reap a rich harvest, it would
      be folly to doubt for a moment. They will scarcely be so weak as not to
      ‘realize,’ in time, by large purchases of houses and land, with other
      property of intrinsic value.
    &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
      In the brief account of Von Kempelen which appeared in the ‘Home Journal,’ 
      and has since been extensively copied, several misapprehensions of the
      German original seem to have been made by the translator, who professes to
      have taken the passage from a late number of the Presburg ‘Schnellpost.’ 
      ‘Viele’ has evidently been misconceived (as it often is), and what the
      translator renders by ‘sorrows,’ is probably ‘lieden,’ which, in its true
      version, ‘sufferings,’ would give a totally different complexion to the
      whole account; but, of course, much of this is merely guess, on my part.
    &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
      Von Kempelen, however, is by no means ‘a misanthrope,’ in appearance, at
      least, whatever he may be in fact. My acquaintance with him was casual
      altogether; and I am scarcely warranted in saying that I know him at all;
      but to have seen and conversed with a man of so &lt;i&gt;prodigious&lt;/i&gt; a notoriety as
      he has attained, or &lt;i&gt;will&lt;/i&gt; attain in a few days, is not a small matter, as
      times go.
    &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
      “The Literary World” speaks of him, confidently, as a native of Presburg
      (misled, perhaps, by the account in “The Home Journal”) but I am pleased
      in being able to state &lt;i&gt;positively&lt;/i&gt;, since I have it from his own lips, that
      he was born in Utica, in the State of New York, although both his parents,
      I believe, are of Presburg descent. The family is connected, in some way,
      with Mäelzel, of Automaton-chess-player memory. In person, he is short and
      stout, with large, &lt;i&gt;fat&lt;/i&gt;, blue eyes, sandy hair and whiskers, a wide but
      pleasing mouth, fine teeth, and I think a Roman nose. There is some defect
      in one of his feet. His address is frank, and his whole manner noticeable
      for bonhomie. Altogether, he looks, speaks, and acts as little like ‘a
      misanthrope’ as any man I ever saw. We were fellow-sojourners for a week
      about six years ago, at Earl’s Hotel, in Providence, Rhode Island; and I
      presume that I conversed with him, at various times, for some three or
      four hours altogether. His principal topics were those of the day; and
      nothing that fell from him led me to suspect his scientific attainments.
      He left the hotel before me, intending to go to New York, and thence to
      Bremen; it was in the latter city that his great discovery was first made
      public; or, rather, it was there that he was first suspected of having
      made it. This is about all that I personally know of the now immortal Von
      Kempelen; but I have thought that even these few details would have
      interest for the public.
    &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
      There can be little question that most of the marvellous rumors afloat
      about this affair are pure inventions, entitled to about as much credit as
      the story of Aladdin’s lamp; and yet, in a case of this kind, as in the
      case of the discoveries in California, it is clear that the truth may be
      stranger than fiction. The following anecdote, at least, is so well
      authenticated, that we may receive it implicitly.
    &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
      Von Kempelen had never been even tolerably well off during his residence
      at Bremen; and often, it was well known, he had been put to extreme shifts
      in order to raise trifling sums. When the great excitement occurred about
      the forgery on the house of Gutsmuth &amp;amp; Co., suspicion was directed
      toward Von Kempelen, on account of his having purchased a considerable
      property in Gasperitch Lane, and his refusing, when questioned, to explain
      how he became possessed of the purchase money. He was at length arrested,
      but nothing decisive appearing against him, was in the end set at liberty.
      The police, however, kept a strict watch upon his movements, and thus
      discovered that he left home frequently, taking always the same road, and
      invariably giving his watchers the slip in the neighborhood of that
      labyrinth of narrow and crooked passages known by the flash name of the
      ‘Dondergat.’ Finally, by dint of great perseverance, they traced him to a
      garret in an old house of seven stories, in an alley called Flatzplatz,—and,
      coming upon him suddenly, found him, as they imagined, in the midst of his
      counterfeiting operations. His agitation is represented as so excessive
      that the officers had not the slightest doubt of his guilt. After
      hand-cuffing him, they searched his room, or rather rooms, for it appears
      he occupied all the mansarde.
    &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
      Opening into the garret where they caught him, was a closet, ten feet by
      eight, fitted up with some chemical apparatus, of which the object has not
      yet been ascertained. In one corner of the closet was a very small
      furnace, with a glowing fire in it, and on the fire a kind of duplicate
      crucible—two crucibles connected by a tube. One of these crucibles
      was nearly full of lead in a state of fusion, but not reaching up to the
      aperture of the tube, which was close to the brim. The other crucible had
      some liquid in it, which, as the officers entered, seemed to be furiously
      dissipating in vapor. They relate that, on finding himself taken, Kempelen
      seized the crucibles with both hands (which were encased in gloves that
      afterwards turned out to be asbestic), and threw the contents on the tiled
      floor. It was now that they hand-cuffed him; and before proceeding to
      ransack the premises they searched his person, but nothing unusual was
      found about him, excepting a paper parcel, in his coat-pocket, containing
      what was afterward ascertained to be a mixture of antimony and some
      unknown substance, in nearly, but not quite, equal proportions. All
      attempts at analyzing the unknown substance have, so far, failed, but that
      it will ultimately be analyzed, is not to be doubted.
    &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
      Passing out of the closet with their prisoner, the officers went through a
      sort of ante-chamber, in which nothing material was found, to the
      chemist’s sleeping-room. They here rummaged some drawers and boxes, but
      discovered only a few papers, of no importance, and some good coin, silver
      and gold. At length, looking under the bed, they saw a large, common hair
      trunk, without hinges, hasp, or lock, and with the top lying carelessly
      across the bottom portion. Upon attempting to draw this trunk out from
      under the bed, they found that, with their united strength (there were
      three of them, all powerful men), they ‘could not stir it one inch.’ Much
      astonished at this, one of them crawled under the bed, and looking into
      the trunk, said:
    &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
      ‘No wonder we couldn’t move it—why it’s full to the brim of old bits
      of brass!’ 
    &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
      Putting his feet, now, against the wall so as to get a good purchase, and
      pushing with all his force, while his companions pulled with all theirs,
      the trunk, with much difficulty, was slid out from under the bed, and its
      contents examined. The supposed brass with which it was filled was all in
      small, smooth pieces, varying from the size of a pea to that of a dollar;
      but the pieces were irregular in shape, although more or less
      flat-looking, upon the whole, “very much as lead looks when thrown upon
      the ground in a molten state, and there suffered to grow cool.” Now, not
      one of these officers for a moment suspected this metal to be anything
      &lt;i&gt;but&lt;/i&gt; brass. The idea of its being &lt;i&gt;gold&lt;/i&gt; never entered their brains, of
      course; how &lt;i&gt;could&lt;/i&gt; such a wild fancy have entered it? And their
      astonishment may be well conceived, when the next day it became known, all
      over Bremen, that the “lot of brass” which they had carted so
      contemptuously to the police office, without putting themselves to the
      trouble of pocketing the smallest scrap, was not only gold—real gold—but
      gold far finer than any employed in coinage—gold, in fact, absolutely
      pure, virgin, without the slightest appreciable alloy.
    &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
      I need not go over the details of Von Kempelen’s confession (as far as it
      went) and release, for these are familiar to the public. That he has
      actually realized, in spirit and in effect, if not to the letter, the old
      chimaera of the philosopher’s stone, no sane person is at liberty to
      doubt. The opinions of Arago are, of course, entitled to the greatest
      consideration; but he is by no means infallible; and what he says of
      bismuth, in his report to the Academy, must be taken &lt;i&gt;cum grano salis&lt;/i&gt;. The
      simple truth is, that up to this period all analysis has failed; and until
      Von Kempelen chooses to let us have the key to his own published enigma,
      it is more than probable that the matter will remain, for years, in statu
      quo. All that as yet can fairly be said to be known is, that ‘Pure gold
      can be made at will, and very readily from lead in connection with certain
      other substances, in kind and in proportions, unknown.’ 
    &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
      Speculation, of course, is busy as to the immediate and ultimate results
      of this discovery—a discovery which few thinking persons will
      hesitate in referring to an increased interest in the matter of gold
      generally, by the late developments in California; and this reflection
      brings us inevitably to another—the exceeding inopportuneness of Von
      Kempelen’s analysis. If many were prevented from adventuring to
      California, by the mere apprehension that gold would so materially
      diminish in value, on account of its plentifulness in the mines there, as
      to render the speculation of going so far in search of it a doubtful one—what
      impression will be wrought now, upon the minds of those about to emigrate,
      and especially upon the minds of those actually in the mineral region, by
      the announcement of this astounding discovery of Von Kempelen? a discovery
      which declares, in so many words, that beyond its intrinsic worth for
      manufacturing purposes (whatever that worth may be), gold now is, or at
      least soon will be (for it cannot be supposed that Von Kempelen can long
      retain his secret), of no greater value than lead, and of far inferior
      value to silver. It is, indeed, exceedingly difficult to speculate
      prospectively upon the consequences of the discovery, but one thing may be
      positively maintained—that the announcement of the discovery six
      months ago would have had material influence in regard to the settlement
      of California.
    &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
      In Europe, as yet, the most noticeable results have been a rise of two
      hundred per cent. in the price of lead, and nearly twenty-five per cent.
      that of silver.

&lt;h2&gt;&lt;a id=&#34;chap2.5&#34;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;MESMERIC REVELATION&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
Whatever doubt may still envelop the &lt;i&gt;rationale&lt;/i&gt; of mesmerism,
its startling &lt;i&gt;facts&lt;/i&gt; are now almost universally admitted. Of these
latter, those who doubt, are your mere doubters by profession—an
unprofitable and disreputable tribe. There can be no more absolute waste
of time than the attempt to &lt;i&gt;prove&lt;/i&gt;, at the present day, that man, by
mere exercise of will, can so impress his fellow, as to cast him into an
abnormal condition, of which the phenomena resemble very closely those
of &lt;i&gt;death&lt;/i&gt;, or at least resemble them more nearly than they do the
phenomena of any other normal condition within our cognizance; that,
while in this state, the person so impressed employs only with effort,
and then feebly, the external organs of sense, yet perceives, with
keenly refined perception, and through channels supposed unknown,
matters beyond the scope of the physical organs; that, moreover, his
intellectual faculties are wonderfully exalted and invigorated; that his
sympathies with the person so impressing him are profound; and, finally,
that his susceptibility to the impression increases with its frequency,
while, in the same proportion, the peculiar phenomena elicited are more
extended and more &lt;i&gt;pronounced&lt;/i&gt;.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
I say that these—which are the laws of mesmerism in its
general features—it would be supererogation to demonstrate; nor shall I
inflict upon my readers so needless a demonstration; to-day. My purpose
at present is a very different one indeed. I am impelled, even in
the teeth of a world of prejudice, to detail without comment the very
remarkable substance of a colloquy, occurring between a sleep-waker and
myself.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
I had been long in the habit of mesmerizing the person in question (Mr.
Vankirk), and the usual acute susceptibility and exaltation of the mesmeric
perception had supervened. For many months he had been laboring under confirmed
phthisis, the more distressing effects of which had been relieved by my
manipulations; and on the night of Wednesday, the fifteenth instant, I was
summoned to his bedside.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
The invalid was suffering with acute pain in the region of the
heart, and breathed with great difficulty, having all the ordinary
symptoms of asthma. In spasms such as these he had usually found relief
from the application of mustard to the nervous centres, but to-night
this had been attempted in vain.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
As I entered his room he greeted me with a cheerful smile, and
although evidently in much bodily pain, appeared to be, mentally, quite
at ease.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
“I sent for you to-night,” he said, “not so much to administer
to my bodily ailment, as to satisfy me concerning certain psychal
impressions which, of late, have occasioned me much anxiety and
surprise. I need not tell you how sceptical I have hitherto been on the
topic of the soul’s immortality. I cannot deny that there has always
existed, as if in that very soul which I have been denying, a vague
half-sentiment of its own existence. But this half-sentiment at no
time amounted to conviction. With it my reason had nothing to do.
All attempts at logical inquiry resulted, indeed, in leaving me more
sceptical than before. I had been advised to study Cousin. I studied
him in his own works as well as in those of his European and American
echoes. The ‘Charles Elwood’ of Mr. Brownson, for example, was placed
in my hands. I read it with profound attention. Throughout I found it
logical, but the portions which were not &lt;i&gt;merely&lt;/i&gt; logical were unhappily
the initial arguments of the disbelieving hero of the book. In his
summing up it seemed evident to me that the reasoner had not even
succeeded in convincing himself. His end had plainly forgotten his
beginning, like the government of Trinculo. In short, I was not long in
perceiving that if man is to be intellectually convinced of his own
immortality, he will never be so convinced by the mere abstractions
which have been so long the fashion of the moralists of England, of
France, and of Germany. Abstractions may amuse and exercise, but take no
hold on the mind. Here upon earth, at least, philosophy, I am persuaded,
will always in vain call upon us to look upon qualities as things. The
will may assent—the soul—the intellect, never.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
“I repeat, then, that I only half felt, and never intellectually
believed. But latterly there has been a certain deepening of the
feeling, until it has come so nearly to resemble the acquiescence of
reason, that I find it difficult to distinguish between the two. I am
enabled, too, plainly to trace this effect to the mesmeric influence.
I cannot better explain my meaning than by the hypothesis that the
mesmeric exaltation enables me to perceive a train of ratiocination
which, in my abnormal existence, convinces, but which, in full
accordance with the mesmeric phenomena, does not extend, except through
its &lt;i&gt;effect&lt;/i&gt;, into my normal condition. In sleep-waking, the reasoning
and its conclusion—the cause and its effect—are present together. In
my natural state, the cause vanishing, the effect only, and perhaps only
partially, remains.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
“These considerations have led me to think that some good
results might ensue from a series of well-directed questions
propounded to me while mesmerized. You have often observed the profound
self-cognizance evinced by the sleep-waker—the extensive knowledge he
displays upon all points relating to the mesmeric condition itself; and
from this self-cognizance may be deduced hints for the proper conduct of
a catechism.”
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
I consented of course to make this experiment.  A few passes
threw Mr. Vankirk into the mesmeric sleep. His breathing became
immediately more easy, and he seemed to suffer no physical uneasiness.
The following conversation then ensued:—V. in the dialogue representing
the patient, and P. myself.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
&lt;i&gt;P.&lt;/i&gt; Are you asleep?
    &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
&lt;i&gt;V.&lt;/i&gt; Yes—no; I would rather sleep more soundly.
    &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
&lt;i&gt;P.&lt;/i&gt; [&lt;i&gt;After a few more passes.&lt;/i&gt;] Do you sleep now?
    &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
&lt;i&gt;V.&lt;/i&gt; Yes.
    &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
&lt;i&gt;P.&lt;/i&gt; How do you think your present illness will result?
    &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
&lt;i&gt;V.&lt;/i&gt; [&lt;i&gt;After a long hesitation and speaking as if with effort&lt;/i&gt;.]
      I must die.
    &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
&lt;i&gt;P.&lt;/i&gt; Does the idea of death afflict you?
    &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
&lt;i&gt;V.&lt;/i&gt; [&lt;i&gt;Very quickly&lt;/i&gt;.] No—no!
    &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
&lt;i&gt;P.&lt;/i&gt; Are you pleased with the prospect?
    &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
&lt;i&gt;V.&lt;/i&gt; If I were awake I should like to die, but now it is no matter.
      The mesmeric condition is so near death as to content me.
    &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
&lt;i&gt;P.&lt;/i&gt; I wish you would explain yourself, Mr. Vankirk.
    &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
&lt;i&gt;V.&lt;/i&gt; I am willing to do so, but it requires more effort than I feel
      able to make. You do not question me properly.
    &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
&lt;i&gt;P.&lt;/i&gt; What then shall I ask?
    &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
&lt;i&gt;V.&lt;/i&gt; You must begin at the beginning.
    &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
&lt;i&gt;P.&lt;/i&gt; The beginning! But where is the beginning?
    &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
&lt;i&gt;V.&lt;/i&gt; You know that the beginning is GOD. [&lt;i&gt;This was said in a low,
      fluctuating tone, and with every sign of the most profound veneration&lt;/i&gt;.]
    &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
&lt;i&gt;P.&lt;/i&gt; What then, is God?
    &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
&lt;i&gt;V.&lt;/i&gt; [&lt;i&gt;Hesitating for many minutes.&lt;/i&gt;] I cannot tell.
    &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
&lt;i&gt;P.&lt;/i&gt; Is not God spirit?
    &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
&lt;i&gt;V.&lt;/i&gt; While I was awake I knew what you meant by “spirit,” but now it
      seems only a word—such, for instance, as truth, beauty—a
      quality, I mean.
    &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
&lt;i&gt;P.&lt;/i&gt; Is not God immaterial?
    &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
&lt;i&gt;V.&lt;/i&gt; There is no immateriality—it is a mere word. That which is
      not matter, is not at all—unless qualities are things.
    &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
&lt;i&gt;P.&lt;/i&gt; Is God, then, material?
    &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
&lt;i&gt;V.&lt;/i&gt; No. [&lt;i&gt;This reply startled me very much.&lt;/i&gt;]
    &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
&lt;i&gt;P.&lt;/i&gt; What, then, is he?
    &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
&lt;i&gt;V.&lt;/i&gt; [&lt;i&gt;After a long pause, and mutteringly.&lt;/i&gt;] I see—but it
      is a thing difficult to tell. [&lt;i&gt;Another long pause.&lt;/i&gt;] He is not
      spirit, for he exists. Nor is he matter, as &lt;i&gt;you understand it&lt;/i&gt;. But
      there are &lt;i&gt;gradations&lt;/i&gt; of matter of which man knows nothing; the
      grosser impelling the finer, the finer pervading the grosser. The
      atmosphere, for example, impels the electric principle, while the electric
      principle permeates the atmosphere. These gradations of matter increase in
      rarity or fineness, until we arrive at a matter &lt;i&gt;unparticled&lt;/i&gt;—without
      particles—indivisible—&lt;i&gt;one;&lt;/i&gt; and here the law of impulsion
      and permeation is modified. The ultimate, or unparticled matter, not only
      permeates all things but impels all things; and thus &lt;i&gt;is&lt;/i&gt; all
      things within itself. This matter is God. What men attempt to embody in
      the word “thought,” is this matter in motion.
    &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
&lt;i&gt;P.&lt;/i&gt; The metaphysicians maintain that all action is reducible to
      motion and thinking, and that the latter is the origin of the former.
    &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
&lt;i&gt;V.&lt;/i&gt; Yes; and I now see the confusion of idea. Motion is the action
      of &lt;i&gt;mind&lt;/i&gt;, not of &lt;i&gt;thinking&lt;/i&gt;. The unparticled matter, or
      God, in quiescence, is (as nearly as we can conceive it) what men call
      mind. And the power of self-movement (equivalent in effect to human
      volition) is, in the unparticled matter, the result of its unity and
      omniprevalence; &lt;i&gt;how&lt;/i&gt; I know not, and now clearly see that I shall
      never know. But the unparticled matter, set in motion by a law, or
      quality, existing within itself, is thinking.
    &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
&lt;i&gt;P.&lt;/i&gt; Can you give me no more precise idea of what you term the
      unparticled matter?
    &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
&lt;i&gt;V.&lt;/i&gt; The matters of which man is cognizant escape the senses in
      gradation. We have, for example, a metal, a piece of wood, a drop of
      water, the atmosphere, a gas, caloric, electricity, the luminiferous
      ether. Now we call all these things matter, and embrace all matter in one
      general definition; but in spite of this, there can be no two ideas more
      essentially distinct than that which we attach to a metal, and that which
      we attach to the luminiferous ether. When we reach the latter, we feel an
      almost irresistible inclination to class it with spirit, or with nihility.
      The only consideration which restrains us is our conception of its atomic
      constitution; and here, even, we have to seek aid from our notion of an
      atom, as something possessing in infinite minuteness, solidity,
      palpability, weight. Destroy the idea of the atomic constitution and we
      should no longer be able to regard the ether as an entity, or at least as
      matter. For want of a better word we might term it spirit. Take, now, a
      step beyond the luminiferous ether—conceive a matter as much more
      rare than the ether, as this ether is more rare than the metal, and we
      arrive at once (in spite of all the school dogmas) at a unique mass—an
      unparticled matter. For although we may admit infinite littleness in the
      atoms themselves, the infinitude of littleness in the spaces between them
      is an absurdity. There will be a point—there will be a degree of
      rarity, at which, if the atoms are sufficiently numerous, the interspaces
      must vanish, and the mass absolutely coalesce. But the consideration of
      the atomic constitution being now taken away, the nature of the mass
      inevitably glides into what we conceive of spirit. It is clear, however,
      that it is as fully matter as before. The truth is, it is impossible to
      conceive spirit, since it is impossible to imagine what is not. When we
      flatter ourselves that we have formed its conception, we have merely
      deceived our understanding by the consideration of infinitely rarified
      matter.
    &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
&lt;i&gt;P.&lt;/i&gt; There seems to me an insurmountable objection to the idea of
      absolute coalescence;—and that is the very slight resistance
      experienced by the heavenly bodies in their revolutions through space—a
      resistance now ascertained, it is true, to exist in &lt;i&gt;some&lt;/i&gt; degree,
      but which is, nevertheless, so slight as to have been quite overlooked by
      the sagacity even of Newton. We know that the resistance of bodies is,
      chiefly, in proportion to their density. Absolute coalescence is absolute
      density. Where there are no interspaces, there can be no yielding. An
      ether, absolutely dense, would put an infinitely more effectual stop to
      the progress of a star than would an ether of adamant or of iron.
    &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
&lt;i&gt;V.&lt;/i&gt; Your objection is answered with an ease which is nearly in the
      ratio of its apparent unanswerability.—As regards the progress of
      the star, it can make no difference whether the star passes through the
      ether &lt;i&gt;or the ether through it&lt;/i&gt;. There is no astronomical error more
      unaccountable than that which reconciles the known retardation of the
      comets with the idea of their passage through an ether: for, however rare
      this ether be supposed, it would put a stop to all sidereal revolution in
      a very far briefer period than has been admitted by those astronomers who
      have endeavored to slur over a point which they found it impossible to
      comprehend. The retardation actually experienced is, on the other hand,
      about that which might be expected from the &lt;i&gt;friction&lt;/i&gt; of the ether
      in the instantaneous passage through the orb. In the one case, the
      retarding force is momentary and complete within itself—in the other
      it is endlessly accumulative.
    &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
&lt;i&gt;P.&lt;/i&gt; But in all this—in this identification of mere matter with
      God—is there nothing of irreverence? [&lt;i&gt;I was forced to repeat this
      question before the sleep-waker fully comprehended my meaning&lt;/i&gt;.]
    &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
&lt;i&gt;V.&lt;/i&gt; Can you say &lt;i&gt;why&lt;/i&gt; matter should be less reverenced than
      mind? But you forget that the matter of which I speak is, in all respects,
      the very “mind” or “spirit” of the schools, so far as regards its high
      capacities, and is, moreover, the “matter” of these schools at the same
      time. God, with all the powers attributed to spirit, is but the perfection
      of matter.
    &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
&lt;i&gt;P.&lt;/i&gt; You assert, then, that the unparticled matter, in motion, is
      thought?
    &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
&lt;i&gt;V.&lt;/i&gt; In general, this motion is the universal thought of the
      universal mind. This thought creates. All created things are but the
      thoughts of God.
    &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
&lt;i&gt;P.&lt;/i&gt; You say, “in general.”
     &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
&lt;i&gt;V.&lt;/i&gt; Yes. The universal mind is God. For new individualities, &lt;i&gt;matter&lt;/i&gt;
      is necessary.
    &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
&lt;i&gt;P.&lt;/i&gt; But you now speak of “mind” and “matter” as do the
      metaphysicians.
    &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
&lt;i&gt;V.&lt;/i&gt; Yes—to avoid confusion. When I say “mind,” I mean the
      unparticled or ultimate matter; by “matter,” I intend all else.
    &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
&lt;i&gt;P.&lt;/i&gt; You were saying that “for new individualities matter is
      necessary.”
     &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
&lt;i&gt;V.&lt;/i&gt; Yes; for mind, existing unincorporate, is merely God. To create
      individual, thinking beings, it was necessary to incarnate portions of the
      divine mind. Thus man is individualized. Divested of corporate
      investiture, he were God. Now, the particular motion of the incarnated
      portions of the unparticled matter is the thought of man; as the motion of
      the whole is that of God.
    &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
&lt;i&gt;P.&lt;/i&gt; You say that divested of the body man will be God?
    &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
&lt;i&gt;V.&lt;/i&gt; [&lt;i&gt;After much hesitation.&lt;/i&gt;] I could not have said this; it
      is an absurdity.
    &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
&lt;i&gt;P.&lt;/i&gt; [&lt;i&gt;Referring to my notes.&lt;/i&gt;] You &lt;i&gt;did&lt;/i&gt; say that
      “divested of corporate investiture man were God.”
     &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
&lt;i&gt;V.&lt;/i&gt; And this is true. Man thus divested &lt;i&gt;would be&lt;/i&gt; God—would
      be unindividualized. But he can never be thus divested—at least
      never &lt;i&gt;will be&lt;/i&gt;—else we must imagine an action of God returning
      upon itself—a purposeless and futile action. Man is a creature.
      Creatures are thoughts of God. It is the nature of thought to be
      irrevocable.
    &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
&lt;i&gt;P.&lt;/i&gt; I do not comprehend. You say that man will never put off the
      body?
    &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
&lt;i&gt;V.&lt;/i&gt; I say that he will never be bodiless.
    &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
&lt;i&gt;P.&lt;/i&gt; Explain.
    &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
&lt;i&gt;V.&lt;/i&gt; There are two bodies—the rudimental and the complete;
      corresponding with the two conditions of the worm and the butterfly. What
      we call “death,” is but the painful metamorphosis. Our present incarnation
      is progressive, preparatory, temporary. Our future is perfected, ultimate,
      immortal. The ultimate life is the full design.
    &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
&lt;i&gt;P.&lt;/i&gt; But of the worm’s metamorphosis we are palpably cognizant.
    &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
&lt;i&gt;V.&lt;/i&gt; &lt;i&gt;We&lt;/i&gt;, certainly—but not the worm. The matter of which
      our rudimental body is composed, is within the ken of the organs of that
      body; or, more distinctly, our rudimental organs are adapted to the matter
      of which is formed the rudimental body; but not to that of which the
      ultimate is composed. The ultimate body thus escapes our rudimental
      senses, and we perceive only the shell which falls, in decaying, from the
      inner form; not that inner form itself; but this inner form, as well as
      the shell, is appreciable by those who have already acquired the ultimate
      life.
    &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
&lt;i&gt;P.&lt;/i&gt; You have often said that the mesmeric state very nearly
      resembles death. How is this?
    &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
&lt;i&gt;V.&lt;/i&gt; When I say that it resembles death, I mean that it resembles the
      ultimate life; for when I am entranced the senses of my rudimental life
      are in abeyance, and I perceive external things directly, without organs,
      through a medium which I shall employ in the ultimate, unorganized life.
    &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
&lt;i&gt;P.&lt;/i&gt; Unorganized?
    &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
&lt;i&gt;V.&lt;/i&gt; Yes; organs are contrivances by which the individual is brought
      into sensible relation with particular classes and forms of matter, to the
      exclusion of other classes and forms. The organs of man are adapted to his
      rudimental condition, and to that only; his ultimate condition, being
      unorganized, is of unlimited comprehension in all points but one—the
      nature of the volition of God—that is to say, the motion of the
      unparticled matter. You will have a distinct idea of the ultimate body by
      conceiving it to be entire brain. This it is &lt;i&gt;not&lt;/i&gt;; but a conception
      of this nature will bring you near a comprehension of what it &lt;i&gt;is&lt;/i&gt;. A
      luminous body imparts vibration to the luminiferous ether. The vibrations
      generate similar ones within the retina; these again communicate similar
      ones to the optic nerve. The nerve conveys similar ones to the brain; the
      brain, also, similar ones to the unparticled matter which permeates it.
      The motion of this latter is thought, of which perception is the first
      undulation. This is the mode by which the mind of the rudimental life
      communicates with the external world; and this external world is, to the
      rudimental life, limited, through the idiosyncrasy of its organs. But in
      the ultimate, unorganized life, the external world reaches the whole body,
      (which is of a substance having affinity to brain, as I have said,) with
      no other intervention than that of an infinitely rarer ether than even the
      luminiferous; and to this ether—in unison with it—the whole
      body vibrates, setting in motion the unparticled matter which permeates
      it. It is to the absence of idiosyncratic organs, therefore, that we must
      attribute the nearly unlimited perception of the ultimate life. To
      rudimental beings, organs are the cages necessary to confine them until
      fledged.
    &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
&lt;i&gt;P.&lt;/i&gt; You speak of rudimental “beings.” Are there other rudimental
      thinking beings than man?
    &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
&lt;i&gt;V.&lt;/i&gt; The multitudinous conglomeration of rare matter into nebulæ,
      planets, suns, and other bodies which are neither nebulæ, suns, nor
      planets, is for the sole purpose of supplying &lt;i&gt;pabulum&lt;/i&gt; for the
      idiosyncrasy of the organs of an infinity of rudimental beings. But for
      the necessity of the rudimental, prior to the ultimate life, there would
      have been no bodies such as these. Each of these is tenanted by a distinct
      variety of organic, rudimental, thinking creatures. In all, the organs
      vary with the features of the place tenanted. At death, or metamorphosis,
      these creatures, enjoying the ultimate life—immortality—and
      cognizant of all secrets but &lt;i&gt;the one&lt;/i&gt;, act all things and pass
      everywhere by mere volition:—indwelling, not the stars, which to us
      seem the sole palpabilities, and for the accommodation of which we blindly
      deem space created—but that SPACE itself—that infinity of
      which the truly substantive vastness swallows up the star-shadows—blotting
      them out as non-entities from the perception of the angels.
    &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
&lt;i&gt;P.&lt;/i&gt; You say that “but for the &lt;i&gt;necessity&lt;/i&gt; of the rudimental
      life” there would have been no stars. But why this necessity?
    &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
&lt;i&gt;V.&lt;/i&gt; In the inorganic life, as well as in the inorganic matter
      generally, there is nothing to impede the action of one simple &lt;i&gt;unique&lt;/i&gt;
      law—the Divine Volition. With the view of producing impediment, the
      organic life and matter, (complex, substantial, and law-encumbered,) were
      contrived.
    &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
&lt;i&gt;P.&lt;/i&gt; But again—why need this impediment have been produced?
    &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
&lt;i&gt;V.&lt;/i&gt; The result of law inviolate is perfection—right—negative
      happiness. The result of law violate is imperfection, wrong, positive
      pain. Through the impediments afforded by the number, complexity, and
      substantiality of the laws of organic life and matter, the violation of
      law is rendered, to a certain extent, practicable. Thus pain, which in the
      inorganic life is impossible, is possible in the organic.
    &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
&lt;i&gt;P.&lt;/i&gt; But to what good end is pain thus rendered possible?
    &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
&lt;i&gt;V.&lt;/i&gt; All things are either good or bad by comparison. A sufficient
      analysis will show that pleasure, in all cases, is but the contrast of
      pain. &lt;i&gt;Positive&lt;/i&gt; pleasure is a mere idea. To be happy at any one
      point we must have suffered at the same. Never to suffer would have been
      never to have been blessed. But it has been shown that, in the inorganic
      life, pain cannot be thus the necessity for the organic. The pain of the
      primitive life of Earth, is the sole basis of the bliss of the ultimate
      life in Heaven.
    &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
&lt;i&gt;P.&lt;/i&gt; Still, there is one of your expressions which I find it
      impossible to comprehend—“the truly &lt;i&gt;substantive&lt;/i&gt; vastness of
      infinity.”
     &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
&lt;i&gt;V.&lt;/i&gt; This, probably, is because you have no sufficiently generic
      conception of the term “&lt;i&gt;substance&lt;/i&gt;” itself. We must not regard it as
      a quality, but as a sentiment:—it is the perception, in thinking
      beings, of the adaptation of matter to their organization. There are many
      things on the Earth, which would be nihility to the inhabitants of Venus—many
      things visible and tangible in Venus, which we could not be brought to
      appreciate as existing at all. But to the inorganic beings—to the
      angels—the whole of the unparticled matter is substance—that
      is to say, the whole of what we term “space” is to them the truest
      substantiality;—the stars, meantime, through what we consider their
      materiality, escaping the angelic sense, just in proportion as the
      unparticled matter, through what we consider its immateriality, eludes the
      organic.
    &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
      As the sleep-waker pronounced these latter words, in a feeble tone, I
      observed on his countenance a singular expression, which somewhat alarmed
      me, and induced me to awake him at once. No sooner had I done this, than,
      with a bright smile irradiating all his features, he fell back upon his
      pillow and expired. I noticed that in less than a minute afterward his
      corpse had all the stern rigidity of stone. His brow was of the coldness
      of ice. Thus, ordinarily, should it have appeared, only after long
      pressure from Azrael’s hand. Had the sleep-waker, indeed, during the
      latter portion of his discourse, been addressing me from out the region of
      the shadows?
    &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;&lt;a id=&#34;chap2.6&#34;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;THE FACTS IN THE CASE OF M. VALDEMAR&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
      Of course I shall not pretend to consider it any matter for wonder, that
      the extraordinary case of M. Valdemar has excited discussion. It would
      have been a miracle had it not—especially under the circumstances. Through
      the desire of all parties concerned, to keep the affair from the public,
      at least for the present, or until we had farther opportunities for
      investigation—through our endeavors to effect this—a garbled
      or exaggerated account made its way into society, and became the source of
      many unpleasant misrepresentations; and, very naturally, of a great deal
      of disbelief.
    &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
      It is now rendered necessary that I give the facts—as far as I
      comprehend them myself. They are, succinctly, these:
    &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
      My attention, for the last three years, had been repeatedly drawn to the
      subject of Mesmerism; and, about nine months ago it occurred to me, quite
      suddenly, that in the series of experiments made hitherto, there had been
      a very remarkable and most unaccountable omission:—no person had as
      yet been mesmerized in articulo mortis. It remained to be seen, first,
      whether, in such condition, there existed in the patient any
      susceptibility to the magnetic influence; secondly, whether, if any
      existed, it was impaired or increased by the condition; thirdly, to what
      extent, or for how long a period, the encroachments of Death might be
      arrested by the process. There were other points to be ascertained, but
      these most excited my curiosity—the last in especial, from the
      immensely important character of its consequences.
    &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
      In looking around me for some subject by whose means I might test these
      particulars, I was brought to think of my friend, M. Ernest Valdemar, the
      well-known compiler of the “Bibliotheca Forensica,” and author (under the
      nom de plume of Issachar Marx) of the Polish versions of “Wallenstein” and
      “Gargantua.” M. Valdemar, who has resided principally at Harlem, N.Y.,
      since the year 1839, is (or was) particularly noticeable for the extreme
      spareness of his person—his lower limbs much resembling those of
      John Randolph; and, also, for the whiteness of his whiskers, in violent
      contrast to the blackness of his hair—the latter, in consequence,
      being very generally mistaken for a wig. His temperament was markedly
      nervous, and rendered him a good subject for mesmeric experiment. On two
      or three occasions I had put him to sleep with little difficulty, but was
      disappointed in other results which his peculiar constitution had
      naturally led me to anticipate. His will was at no period positively, or
      thoroughly, under my control, and in regard to clairvoyance, I could
      accomplish with him nothing to be relied upon. I always attributed my
      failure at these points to the disordered state of his health. For some
      months previous to my becoming acquainted with him, his physicians had
      declared him in a confirmed phthisis. It was his custom, indeed, to speak
      calmly of his approaching dissolution, as of a matter neither to be
      avoided nor regretted.
    &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
      When the ideas to which I have alluded first occurred to me, it was of
      course very natural that I should think of M. Valdemar. I knew the steady
      philosophy of the man too well to apprehend any scruples from him; and he
      had no relatives in America who would be likely to interfere. I spoke to
      him frankly upon the subject; and, to my surprise, his interest seemed
      vividly excited. I say to my surprise, for, although he had always yielded
      his person freely to my experiments, he had never before given me any
      tokens of sympathy with what I did. His disease was of that character
      which would admit of exact calculation in respect to the epoch of its
      termination in death; and it was finally arranged between us that he would
      send for me about twenty-four hours before the period announced by his
      physicians as that of his decease.
    &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
      It is now rather more than seven months since I received, from M. Valdemar
      himself, the subjoined note:
    &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&#34;p2&#34;&gt;
      M&lt;small&gt;Y&lt;/small&gt; D&lt;small&gt;EAR&lt;/small&gt; P——,
    &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
      You may as well come now. D—— and F—— are agreed
      that I cannot hold out beyond to-morrow midnight; and I think they have
      hit the time very nearly.
    &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&#34;right&#34;&gt;
      V&lt;small&gt;ALDEMAR&lt;/small&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
      I received this note within half an hour after it was written, and in
      fifteen minutes more I was in the dying man’s chamber. I had not seen him
      for ten days, and was appalled by the fearful alteration which the brief
      interval had wrought in him. His face wore a leaden hue; the eyes were
      utterly lustreless; and the emaciation was so extreme that the skin had
      been broken through by the cheek-bones. His expectoration was excessive.
      The pulse was barely perceptible. He retained, nevertheless, in a very
      remarkable manner, both his mental power and a certain degree of physical
      strength. He spoke with distinctness—took some palliative medicines
      without aid—and, when I entered the room, was occupied in penciling
      memoranda in a pocket-book. He was propped up in the bed by pillows.
      Doctors D—— and F—— were in attendance.
    &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
      After pressing Valdemar’s hand, I took these gentlemen aside, and obtained
      from them a minute account of the patient’s condition. The left lung had
      been for eighteen months in a semi-osseous or cartilaginous state, and
      was, of course, entirely useless for all purposes of vitality. The right,
      in its upper portion, was also partially, if not thoroughly, ossified,
      while the lower region was merely a mass of purulent tubercles, running
      one into another. Several extensive perforations existed; and, at one
      point, permanent adhesion to the ribs had taken place. These appearances
      in the right lobe were of comparatively recent date. The ossification had
      proceeded with very unusual rapidity; no sign of it had been discovered a
      month before, and the adhesion had only been observed during the three
      previous days. Independently of the phthisis, the patient was suspected of
      aneurism of the aorta; but on this point the osseous symptoms rendered an
      exact diagnosis impossible. It was the opinion of both physicians that M.
      Valdemar would die about midnight on the morrow (Sunday). It was then
      seven o’clock on Saturday evening.
    &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
      On quitting the invalid’s bed-side to hold conversation with myself,
      Doctors D—— and F—— had bidden him a final
      farewell. It had not been their intention to return; but, at my request,
      they agreed to look in upon the patient about ten the next night.
    &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
      When they had gone, I spoke freely with M. Valdemar on the subject of his
      approaching dissolution, as well as, more particularly, of the experiment
      proposed. He still professed himself quite willing and even anxious to
      have it made, and urged me to commence it at once. A male and a female
      nurse were in attendance; but I did not feel myself altogether at liberty
      to engage in a task of this character with no more reliable witnesses than
      these people, in case of sudden accident, might prove. I therefore
      postponed operations until about eight the next night, when the arrival of
      a medical student with whom I had some acquaintance, (Mr. Theodore L—l,)
      relieved me from farther embarrassment. It had been my design, originally,
      to wait for the physicians; but I was induced to proceed, first, by the
      urgent entreaties of M. Valdemar, and secondly, by my conviction that I
      had not a moment to lose, as he was evidently sinking fast.
    &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
      Mr. L—l was so kind as to accede to my desire that he would take
      notes of all that occurred, and it is from his memoranda that what I now
      have to relate is, for the most part, either condensed or copied verbatim.
    &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
      It wanted about five minutes of eight when, taking the patient’s hand, I
      begged him to state, as distinctly as he could, to Mr. L—l, whether
      he (M. Valdemar) was entirely willing that I should make the experiment of
      mesmerizing him in his then condition.
    &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
      He replied feebly, yet quite audibly, “Yes, I wish to be. I fear
      you have mesmerized”—adding immediately afterwards: “I
      fear you have deferred it too long.”
     &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
      While he spoke thus, I commenced the passes which I had already found most
      effectual in subduing him. He was evidently influenced with the first
      lateral stroke of my hand across his forehead; but although I exerted all
      my powers, no further perceptible effect was induced until some minutes
      after ten o’clock, when Doctors D—— and F—— called, according to
      appointment. I explained to them, in a few words, what I designed, and as
      they opposed no objection, saying that the patient was already in the
      death agony, I proceeded without hesitation—exchanging, however, the
      lateral passes for downward ones, and directing my gaze entirely into the
      right eye of the sufferer.
    &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
      By this time his pulse was imperceptible and his breathing was stertorous,
      and at intervals of half a minute.
    &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
      This condition was nearly unaltered for a quarter of an hour. At the
      expiration of this period, however, a natural although a very deep sigh
      escaped the bosom of the dying man, and the stertorous breathing ceased—that
      is to say, its stertorousness was no longer apparent; the intervals were
      undiminished. The patient’s extremities were of an icy coldness.
    &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
      At five minutes before eleven I perceived unequivocal signs of the
      mesmeric influence. The glassy roll of the eye was changed for that
      expression of uneasy inward examination which is never seen except in
      cases of sleep-waking, and which it is quite impossible to mistake. With a
      few rapid lateral passes I made the lids quiver, as in incipient sleep,
      and with a few more I closed them altogether. I was not satisfied,
      however, with this, but continued the manipulations vigorously, and with
      the fullest exertion of the will, until I had completely stiffened the
      limbs of the slumberer, after placing them in a seemingly easy position.
      The legs were at full length; the arms were nearly so, and reposed on the
      bed at a moderate distance from the loin. The head was very slightly
      elevated.
    &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
      When I had accomplished this, it was fully midnight, and I requested the
      gentlemen present to examine M. Valdemar’s condition. After a few
      experiments, they admitted him to be an unusually perfect state of
      mesmeric trance. The curiosity of both the physicians was greatly excited.
      Dr. D—— resolved at once to remain with the patient all night,
      while Dr. F—— took leave with a promise to return at daybreak.
      Mr. L—l and the nurses remained.
    &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
      We left M. Valdemar entirely undisturbed until about three o’clock in the
      morning, when I approached him and found him in precisely the same
      condition as when Dr. F—— went away—that is to say, he lay in
      the same position; the pulse was imperceptible; the breathing was gentle
      (scarcely noticeable, unless through the application of a mirror to the
      lips); the eyes were closed naturally; and the limbs were as rigid and as
      cold as marble. Still, the general appearance was certainly not that of
      death.
    &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
      As I approached M. Valdemar I made a kind of half effort to influence his
      right arm into pursuit of my own, as I passed the latter gently to and fro
      above his person. In such experiments with this patient, I had never
      perfectly succeeded before, and assuredly I had little thought of
      succeeding now; but to my astonishment, his arm very readily, although
      feebly, followed every direction I assigned it with mine. I determined to
      hazard a few words of conversation.
    &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
      “M. Valdemar,” I said, “are you asleep?” He made no answer, but I
      perceived a tremor about the lips, and was thus induced to repeat the
      question, again and again. At its third repetition, his whole frame was
      agitated by a very slight shivering; the eyelids unclosed themselves so
      far as to display a white line of the ball; the lips moved sluggishly, and
      from between them, in a barely audible whisper, issued the words:
    &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
      “Yes;—asleep now. Do not wake me!—let me die so!”
     &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
      I here felt the limbs and found them as rigid as ever. The right arm, as
      before, obeyed the direction of my hand. I questioned the sleep-waker
      again:
    &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
      “Do you still feel pain in the breast, M. Valdemar?”
     &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
      The answer now was immediate, but even less audible than before:
     &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
      “No pain—I am dying.”
     &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
      I did not think it advisable to disturb him farther just then, and nothing
      more was said or done until the arrival of Dr. F——, who came a little
      before sunrise, and expressed unbounded astonishment at finding the
      patient still alive. After feeling the pulse and applying a mirror to the
      lips, he requested me to speak to the sleep-waker again. I did so, saying:
    &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
      “M. Valdemar, do you still sleep?”
     &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
      As before, some minutes elapsed ere a reply was made; and during the
      interval the dying man seemed to be collecting his energies to speak. At
      my fourth repetition of the question, he said very faintly, almost
      inaudibly:
    &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
      “Yes; still asleep—dying.”
     &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
      It was now the opinion, or rather the wish, of the physicians, that M.
      Valdemar should be suffered to remain undisturbed in his present
      apparently tranquil condition, until death should supervene—and
      this, it was generally agreed, must now take place within a few minutes. I
      concluded, however, to speak to him once more, and merely repeated my
      previous question.
    &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
      While I spoke, there came a marked change over the countenance of the
      sleep-waker. The eyes rolled themselves slowly open, the pupils
      disappearing upwardly; the skin generally assumed a cadaverous hue,
      resembling not so much parchment as white paper; and the circular hectic
      spots which, hitherto, had been strongly defined in the centre of each
      cheek, went out at once. I use this expression, because the suddenness of
      their departure put me in mind of nothing so much as the extinguishment of
      a candle by a puff of the breath. The upper lip, at the same time, writhed
      itself away from the teeth, which it had previously covered completely;
      while the lower jaw fell with an audible jerk, leaving the mouth widely
      extended, and disclosing in full view the swollen and blackened tongue. I
      presume that no member of the party then present had been unaccustomed to
      death-bed horrors; but so hideous beyond conception was the appearance of
      M. Valdemar at this moment, that there was a general shrinking back from
      the region of the bed.
    &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
      I now feel that I have reached a point of this narrative at which every
      reader will be startled into positive disbelief. It is my business,
      however, simply to proceed.
    &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
      There was no longer the faintest sign of vitality in M. Valdemar; and
      concluding him to be dead, we were consigning him to the charge of the
      nurses, when a strong vibratory motion was observable in the tongue. This
      continued for perhaps a minute. At the expiration of this period, there
      issued from the distended and motionless jaws a voice—such as it
      would be madness in me to attempt describing. There are, indeed, two or
      three epithets which might be considered as applicable to it in part; I
      might say, for example, that the sound was harsh, and broken and hollow;
      but the hideous whole is indescribable, for the simple reason that no
      similar sounds have ever jarred upon the ear of humanity. There were two
      particulars, nevertheless, which I thought then, and still think, might
      fairly be stated as characteristic of the intonation—as well adapted
      to convey some idea of its unearthly peculiarity. In the first place, the
      voice seemed to reach our ears—at least mine—from a vast
      distance, or from some deep cavern within the earth. In the second place,
      it impressed me (I fear, indeed, that it will be impossible to make myself
      comprehended) as gelatinous or glutinous matters impress the sense of
      touch.
    &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
      I have spoken both of “sound” and of “voice.” I mean to say that the sound
      was one of distinct—of even wonderfully, thrillingly distinct—syllabification.
      M. Valdemar spoke—obviously in reply to the question I had
      propounded to him a few minutes before. I had asked him, it will be
      remembered, if he still slept. He now said:
    &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
      “Yes;—no;—I have been sleeping—and now—now—I
      am dead.”
     &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
      No person present even affected to deny, or attempted to repress, the
      unutterable, shuddering horror which these few words, thus uttered, were
      so well calculated to convey. Mr. L—l (the student) swooned. The
      nurses immediately left the chamber, and could not be induced to return.
      My own impressions I would not pretend to render intelligible to the
      reader. For nearly an hour, we busied ourselves, silently—without
      the utterance of a word—in endeavors to revive Mr. L—l. When
      he came to himself, we addressed ourselves again to an investigation of M.
      Valdemar’s condition.
    &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
      It remained in all respects as I have last described it, with the
      exception that the mirror no longer afforded evidence of respiration. An
      attempt to draw blood from the arm failed. I should mention, too, that
      this limb was no farther subject to my will. I endeavored in vain to make
      it follow the direction of my hand. The only real indication, indeed, of
      the mesmeric influence, was now found in the vibratory movement of the
      tongue, whenever I addressed M. Valdemar a question. He seemed to be
      making an effort to reply, but had no longer sufficient volition. To
      queries put to him by any other person than myself he seemed utterly
      insensible—although I endeavored to place each member of the company
      in mesmeric rapport with him. I believe that I have now related all that
      is necessary to an understanding of the sleep-waker’s state at this epoch.
      Other nurses were procured; and at ten o’clock I left the house in company
      with the two physicians and Mr. L—l.
    &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
      In the afternoon we all called again to see the patient. His condition
      remained precisely the same. We had now some discussion as to the
      propriety and feasibility of awakening him; but we had little difficulty
      in agreeing that no good purpose would be served by so doing. It was
      evident that, so far, death (or what is usually termed death) had been
      arrested by the mesmeric process. It seemed clear to us all that to awaken
      M. Valdemar would be merely to insure his instant, or at least his speedy,
      dissolution.
    &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
      From this period until the close of last week—an interval of nearly
      seven months—we continued to make daily calls at M. Valdemar’s
      house, accompanied, now and then, by medical and other friends. All this
      time the sleeper-waker remained &lt;i&gt;exactly&lt;/i&gt; as I have last described him. The
      nurses’ attentions were continual.
    &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
      It was on Friday last that we finally resolved to make the experiment of
      awakening, or attempting to awaken him; and it is the (perhaps) unfortunate
      result of this latter experiment which has given rise to so much
      discussion in private circles—to so much of what I cannot help
      thinking unwarranted popular feeling.
    &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
      For the purpose of relieving M. Valdemar from the mesmeric trance, I made
      use of the customary passes. These, for a time, were unsuccessful. The
      first indication of revival was afforded by a partial descent of the iris.
      It was observed, as especially remarkable, that this lowering of the pupil
      was accompanied by the profuse out-flowing of a yellowish ichor (from
      beneath the lids) of a pungent and highly offensive odor.
    &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
      It was now suggested that I should attempt to influence the patient’s arm,
      as heretofore. I made the attempt and failed. Dr. F—— then intimated a
      desire to have me put a question. I did so, as follows:
    &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
      “M. Valdemar, can you explain to us what are your feelings or wishes now?”
     &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
      There was an instant return of the hectic circles on the cheeks; the
      tongue quivered, or rather rolled violently in the mouth (although the
      jaws and lips remained rigid as before), and at length the same hideous
      voice which I have already described, broke forth:
    &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
      “For God’s sake!—quick!—quick!—put me to sleep—or,
      quick!—waken me!—quick!—I say to you that I am dead!”
     &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
      I was thoroughly unnerved, and for an instant remained undecided what to
      do. At first I made an endeavor to recompose the patient; but, failing in
      this through total abeyance of the will, I retraced my steps and as
      earnestly struggled to awaken him. In this attempt I soon saw that I
      should be successful—or at least I soon fancied that my success
      would be complete—and I am sure that all in the room were prepared
      to see the patient awaken.
    &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
      For what really occurred, however, it is quite impossible that any human
      being could have been prepared.
    &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
      As I rapidly made the mesmeric passes, amid ejaculations of “dead! dead!”
       absolutely bursting from the tongue and not from the lips of the sufferer,
      his whole frame at once—within the space of a single minute, or even
      less, shrunk—crumbled—absolutely rotted away beneath my hands.
      Upon the bed, before that whole company, there lay a nearly liquid mass of
      loathsome—of detestable putrescence.
    &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
      For the most wild, yet most homely narrative which I am about to pen, I
      neither expect nor solicit belief. Mad indeed would I be to expect it, in
      a case where my very senses reject their own evidence. Yet, mad am I not—and
      very surely do I not dream. But to-morrow I die, and to-day I would
      unburthen my soul. My immediate purpose is to place before the world,
      plainly, succinctly, and without comment, a series of mere household
      events. In their consequences, these events have terrified—have
      tortured—have destroyed me. Yet I will not attempt to expound them.
      To me, they have presented little but horror—to many they will seem
      less terrible than &lt;i&gt;barroques&lt;/i&gt;. Hereafter, perhaps, some intellect
      may be found which will reduce my phantasm to the common-place—some
      intellect more calm, more logical, and far less excitable than my own,
      which will perceive, in the circumstances I detail with awe, nothing more
      than an ordinary succession of very natural causes and effects.
    &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
      From my infancy I was noted for the docility and humanity of my
      disposition. My tenderness of heart was even so conspicuous as to make me
      the jest of my companions. I was especially fond of animals, and was
      indulged by my parents with a great variety of pets. With these I spent
      most of my time, and never was so happy as when feeding and caressing
      them. This peculiarity of character grew with my growth, and in my
      manhood, I derived from it one of my principal sources of pleasure. To
      those who have cherished an affection for a faithful and sagacious dog, I
      need hardly be at the trouble of explaining the nature or the intensity of
      the gratification thus derivable. There is something in the unselfish and
      self-sacrificing love of a brute, which goes directly to the heart of him
      who has had frequent occasion to test the paltry friendship and gossamer
      fidelity of mere &lt;i&gt;Man&lt;/i&gt;.
    &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
      I married early, and was happy to find in my wife a disposition not
      uncongenial with my own. Observing my partiality for domestic pets, she
      lost no opportunity of procuring those of the most agreeable kind. We had
      birds, gold-fish, a fine dog, rabbits, a small monkey, and &lt;i&gt;a cat&lt;/i&gt;.
    &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
      This latter was a remarkably large and beautiful animal, entirely black,
      and sagacious to an astonishing degree. In speaking of his intelligence,
      my wife, who at heart was not a little tinctured with superstition, made
      frequent allusion to the ancient popular notion, which regarded all black
      cats as witches in disguise. Not that she was ever &lt;i&gt;serious&lt;/i&gt; upon
      this point—and I mention the matter at all for no better reason than
      that it happens, just now, to be remembered.
    &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
      Pluto—this was the cat’s name—was my favorite pet and
      playmate. I alone fed him, and he attended me wherever I went about the
      house. It was even with difficulty that I could prevent him from following
      me through the streets.
    &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
      Our friendship lasted, in this manner, for several years, during which my
      general temperament and character—through the instrumentality of the
      Fiend Intemperance—had (I blush to confess it) experienced a radical
      alteration for the worse. I grew, day by day, more moody, more irritable,
      more regardless of the feelings of others. I suffered myself to use
      intemperate language to my wife. At length, I even offered her personal
      violence. My pets, of course, were made to feel the change in my
      disposition. I not only neglected, but ill-used them. For Pluto, however,
      I still retained sufficient regard to restrain me from maltreating him, as
      I made no scruple of maltreating the rabbits, the monkey, or even the dog,
      when by accident, or through affection, they came in my way. But my
      disease grew upon me—for what disease is like Alcohol!—and at
      length even Pluto, who was now becoming old, and consequently somewhat
      peevish—even Pluto began to experience the effects of my ill temper.
    &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
      One night, returning home, much intoxicated, from one of my haunts about
      town, I fancied that the cat avoided my presence. I seized him; when, in
      his fright at my violence, he inflicted a slight wound upon my hand with
      his teeth. The fury of a demon instantly possessed me. I knew myself no
      longer. My original soul seemed, at once, to take its flight from my body
      and a more than fiendish malevolence, gin-nurtured, thrilled every fibre
      of my frame. I took from my waistcoat-pocket a pen-knife, opened it,
      grasped the poor beast by the throat, and deliberately cut one of its eyes
      from the socket! I blush, I burn, I shudder, while I pen the damnable
      atrocity.
    &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
      When reason returned with the morning—when I had slept off the fumes
      of the night’s debauch—I experienced a sentiment half of horror,
      half of remorse, for the crime of which I had been guilty; but it was, at
      best, a feeble and equivocal feeling, and the soul remained untouched. I
      again plunged into excess, and soon drowned in wine all memory of the
      deed.
    &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
      In the meantime the cat slowly recovered. The socket of the lost eye
      presented, it is true, a frightful appearance, but he no longer appeared
      to suffer any pain. He went about the house as usual, but, as might be
      expected, fled in extreme terror at my approach. I had so much of my old
      heart left, as to be at first grieved by this evident dislike on the part
      of a creature which had once so loved me. But this feeling soon gave
      place to irritation. And then came, as if to my final and irrevocable
      overthrow, the spirit of P&lt;small&gt;ERVERSENESS&lt;/small&gt;. Of this spirit
      philosophy takes no account. Yet I am not more sure that my soul lives,
      than I am that perverseness is one of the primitive impulses of the human
      heart—one of the indivisible primary faculties, or sentiments,
      which give direction to the character of Man. Who has not, a hundred
      times, found himself committing a vile or a silly action, for no other
      reason than because he knows he should not? Have we not a perpetual
      inclination, in the teeth of our best judgment, to violate that which is
      &lt;i&gt;Law&lt;/i&gt;, merely because we understand it to be such? This spirit of
      perverseness, I say, came to my final overthrow. It was this unfathomable
      longing of the soul &lt;i&gt;to vex itself&lt;/i&gt;—to offer violence to its
      own nature—to do wrong for the wrong’s sake only—that
      urged me to continue and finally to consummate the injury I had inflicted
      upon the unoffending brute. One morning, in cool blood, I slipped a noose
      about its neck and hung it to the limb of a tree;—hung it with the
      tears streaming from my eyes, and with the bitterest remorse at my
      heart;—hung it &lt;i&gt;because&lt;/i&gt; I knew that it had loved me, and
      &lt;i&gt;because&lt;/i&gt; I felt it had given me no reason of offence;—hung it
      &lt;i&gt;because&lt;/i&gt; I knew that in so doing I was committing a sin—a
      deadly sin that would so jeopardize my immortal soul as to place
      it—if such a thing wore possible—even beyond the reach of the
      infinite mercy of the Most Merciful and Most Terrible God.
    &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
      On the night of the day on which this cruel deed was done, I was aroused
      from sleep by the cry of fire. The curtains of my bed were in flames. The
      whole house was blazing. It was with great difficulty that my wife, a
      servant, and myself, made our escape from the conflagration. The
      destruction was complete. My entire worldly wealth was swallowed up, and I
      resigned myself thenceforward to despair.
    &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
      I am above the weakness of seeking to establish a sequence of cause and
      effect, between the disaster and the atrocity. But I am detailing a chain
      of facts—and wish not to leave even a possible link imperfect. On
      the day succeeding the fire, I visited the ruins. The walls, with one
      exception, had fallen in. This exception was found in a compartment wall,
      not very thick, which stood about the middle of the house, and against
      which had rested the head of my bed. The plastering had here, in great
      measure, resisted the action of the fire—a fact which I attributed
      to its having been recently spread. About this wall a dense crowd were
      collected, and many persons seemed to be examining a particular portion of
      it with very minute and eager attention. The words “strange!” “singular!”
       and other similar expressions, excited my curiosity. I approached and saw,
      as if graven in &lt;i&gt;bas relief&lt;/i&gt; upon the white surface, the figure of a
      gigantic &lt;i&gt;cat&lt;/i&gt;. The impression was given with an accuracy truly
      marvellous. There was a rope about the animal’s neck.
    &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
      When I first beheld this apparition—for I could scarcely regard it
      as less—my wonder and my terror were extreme. But at length
      reflection came to my aid. The cat, I remembered, had been hung in a
      garden adjacent to the house. Upon the alarm of fire, this garden had been
      immediately filled by the crowd—by some one of whom the animal must
      have been cut from the tree and thrown, through an open window, into my
      chamber. This had probably been done with the view of arousing me from
      sleep. The falling of other walls had compressed the victim of my cruelty
      into the substance of the freshly-spread plaster; the lime of which, with
      the flames, and the &lt;i&gt;ammonia&lt;/i&gt; from the carcass, had then accomplished
      the portraiture as I saw it.
    &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
      Although I thus readily accounted to my reason, if not altogether to my
      conscience, for the startling fact just detailed, it did not the less fail
      to make a deep impression upon my fancy. For months I could not rid myself
      of the phantasm of the cat; and, during this period, there came back into
      my spirit a half-sentiment that seemed, but was not, remorse. I went so
      far as to regret the loss of the animal, and to look about me, among the
      vile haunts which I now habitually frequented, for another pet of the same
      species, and of somewhat similar appearance, with which to supply its
      place.
    &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
      One night as I sat, half stupefied, in a den of more than infamy, my
      attention was suddenly drawn to some black object, reposing upon the head
      of one of the immense hogsheads of gin, or of rum, which constituted the
      chief furniture of the apartment. I had been looking steadily at the top
      of this hogshead for some minutes, and what now caused me surprise was the
      fact that I had not sooner perceived the object thereupon. I approached
      it, and touched it with my hand. It was a black cat—a very large one—fully
      as large as Pluto, and closely resembling him in every respect but one.
      Pluto had not a white hair upon any portion of his body; but this cat had
      a large, although indefinite splotch of white, covering nearly the whole
      region of the breast. Upon my touching him, he immediately arose, purred
      loudly, rubbed against my hand, and appeared delighted with my notice.
      This, then, was the very creature of which I was in search. I at once
      offered to purchase it of the landlord; but this person made no claim to
      it—knew nothing of it—had never seen it before.
    &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
      I continued my caresses, and, when I prepared to go home, the animal
      evinced a disposition to accompany me. I permitted it to do so;
      occasionally stooping and patting it as I proceeded. When it reached the
      house it domesticated itself at once, and became immediately a great
      favorite with my wife.
    &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
      For my own part, I soon found a dislike to it arising within me. This was
      just the reverse of what I had anticipated; but—I know not how or
      why it was—its evident fondness for myself rather disgusted and
      annoyed. By slow degrees, these feelings of disgust and annoyance rose
      into the bitterness of hatred. I avoided the creature; a certain sense of
      shame, and the remembrance of my former deed of cruelty, preventing me
      from physically abusing it. I did not, for some weeks, strike, or
      otherwise violently ill use it; but gradually—very gradually—I
      came to look upon it with unutterable loathing, and to flee silently from
      its odious presence, as from the breath of a pestilence.
    &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
      What added, no doubt, to my hatred of the beast, was the discovery, on the
      morning after I brought it home, that, like Pluto, it also had been
      deprived of one of its eyes. This circumstance, however, only endeared it
      to my wife, who, as I have already said, possessed, in a high degree, that
      humanity of feeling which had once been my distinguishing trait, and the
      source of many of my simplest and purest pleasures.
    &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
      With my aversion to this cat, however, its partiality for myself seemed to
      increase. It followed my footsteps with a pertinacity which it would be
      difficult to make the reader comprehend. Whenever I sat, it would crouch
      beneath my chair, or spring upon my knees, covering me with its loathsome
      caresses. If I arose to walk it would get between my feet and thus nearly
      throw me down, or, fastening its long and sharp claws in my dress,
      clamber, in this manner, to my breast. At such times, although I longed to
      destroy it with a blow, I was yet withheld from so doing, partly by a
      memory of my former crime, but chiefly—let me confess it at once—by
      absolute dread of the beast.
    &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
      This dread was not exactly a dread of physical evil—and yet I should
      be at a loss how otherwise to define it. I am almost ashamed to own—yes,
      even in this felon’s cell, I am almost ashamed to own—that the
      terror and horror with which the animal inspired me, had been heightened
      by one of the merest chimaeras it would be possible to conceive. My wife
      had called my attention, more than once, to the character of the mark of
      white hair, of which I have spoken, and which constituted the sole visible
      difference between the strange beast and the one I had destroyed. The
      reader will remember that this mark, although large, had been originally
      very indefinite; but, by slow degrees—degrees nearly imperceptible,
      and which for a long time my reason struggled to reject as fanciful—it
      had, at length, assumed a rigorous distinctness of outline. It was now the
      representation of an object that I shudder to name—and for this,
      above all, I loathed, and dreaded, and would have rid myself of the
      monster &lt;i&gt;had I dared&lt;/i&gt;—it was now, I say, the image of a hideous—of
      a ghastly thing—of the GALLOWS!—oh, mournful and terrible
      engine of Horror and of Crime—of Agony and of Death!
    &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
      And now was I indeed wretched beyond the wretchedness of mere Humanity.
      And &lt;i&gt;a brute beast &lt;/i&gt;—whose fellow I had contemptuously
      destroyed—&lt;i&gt;a brute beast&lt;/i&gt; to work out for &lt;i&gt;me&lt;/i&gt;—for
      me a man, fashioned in the image of the High God—so much of
      insufferable woe! Alas! neither by day nor by night knew I the blessing of
      rest any more! During the former the creature left me no moment alone,
      and in the latter I started hourly from dreams of unutterable fear to
      find the hot breath of &lt;i&gt;the thing&lt;/i&gt; upon my face, and its vast weight—an
      incarnate nightmare that I had no power to shake off—incumbent
      eternally upon my &lt;i&gt;heart!&lt;/i&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
      Beneath the pressure of torments such as these, the feeble remnant of the
      good within me succumbed. Evil thoughts became my sole intimates—the
      darkest and most evil of thoughts. The moodiness of my usual temper
      increased to hatred of all things and of all mankind; while, from the
      sudden, frequent, and ungovernable outbursts of a fury to which I now
      blindly abandoned myself, my uncomplaining wife, alas, was the most usual
      and the most patient of sufferers.
    &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
      One day she accompanied me, upon some household errand, into the cellar of
      the old building which our poverty compelled us to inhabit. The cat
      followed me down the steep stairs, and, nearly throwing me headlong,
      exasperated me to madness. Uplifting an axe, and forgetting, in my wrath,
      the childish dread which had hitherto stayed my hand, I aimed a blow at
      the animal which, of course, would have proved instantly fatal had it
      descended as I wished. But this blow was arrested by the hand of my wife.
      Goaded, by the interference, into a rage more than demoniacal, I withdrew
      my arm from her grasp and buried the axe in her brain. She fell dead upon
      the spot, without a groan.
    &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
      This hideous murder accomplished, I set myself forthwith, and with entire
      deliberation, to the task of concealing the body. I knew that I could not
      remove it from the house, either by day or by night, without the risk of
      being observed by the neighbors. Many projects entered my mind. At one
      period I thought of cutting the corpse into minute fragments, and
      destroying them by fire. At another, I resolved to dig a grave for it in
      the floor of the cellar. Again, I deliberated about casting it in the well
      in the yard—about packing it in a box, as if merchandise, with the
      usual arrangements, and so getting a porter to take it from the house.
      Finally I hit upon what I considered a far better expedient than either of
      these. I determined to wall it up in the cellar—as the monks of the
      middle ages are recorded to have walled up their victims.
    &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
      For a purpose such as this the cellar was well adapted. Its walls were
      loosely constructed, and had lately been plastered throughout with a rough
      plaster, which the dampness of the atmosphere had prevented from
      hardening. Moreover, in one of the walls was a projection, caused by a
      false chimney, or fireplace, that had been filled up, and made to resemble
      the red of the cellar. I made no doubt that I could readily displace the
      bricks at this point, insert the corpse, and wall the whole up as before,
      so that no eye could detect any thing suspicious. And in this calculation
      I was not deceived. By means of a crow-bar I easily dislodged the bricks,
      and, having carefully deposited the body against the inner wall, I propped
      it in that position, while, with little trouble, I re-laid the whole
      structure as it originally stood. Having procured mortar, sand, and hair,
      with every possible precaution, I prepared a plaster which could not be
      distinguished from the old, and with this I very carefully went over the
      new brickwork. When I had finished, I felt satisfied that all was right.
      The wall did not present the slightest appearance of having been
      disturbed. The rubbish on the floor was picked up with the minutest care.
      I looked around triumphantly, and said to myself: “Here at least,
      then, my labor has not been in vain.”
     &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
      My next step was to look for the beast which had been the cause of so much
      wretchedness; for I had, at length, firmly resolved to put it to death.
      Had I been able to meet with it, at the moment, there could have been no
      doubt of its fate; but it appeared that the crafty animal had been alarmed
      at the violence of my previous anger, and forebore to present itself in my
      present mood. It is impossible to describe, or to imagine, the deep, the
      blissful sense of relief which the absence of the detested creature
      occasioned in my bosom. It did not make its appearance during the night; and
      thus for one night at least, since its introduction into the house, I
      soundly and tranquilly slept; aye, slept even with the burden of murder
      upon my soul!
    &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
      The second and the third day passed, and still my tormentor came not. Once
      again I breathed as a freeman. The monster, in terror, had fled the
      premises forever! I should behold it no more! My happiness was supreme!
      The guilt of my dark deed disturbed me but little. Some few inquiries had
      been made, but these had been readily answered. Even a search had been
      instituted—but of course nothing was to be discovered. I looked upon
      my future felicity as secured.
    &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
      Upon the fourth day of the assassination, a party of the police came, very
      unexpectedly, into the house, and proceeded again to make rigorous
      investigation of the premises. Secure, however, in the inscrutability of
      my place of concealment, I felt no embarrassment whatever. The officers
      bade me accompany them in their search. They left no nook or corner
      unexplored. At length, for the third or fourth time, they descended into
      the cellar. I quivered not in a muscle. My heart beat calmly as that of
      one who slumbers in innocence. I walked the cellar from end to end. I
      folded my arms upon my bosom, and roamed easily to and fro. The police
      were thoroughly satisfied and prepared to depart. The glee at my heart was
      too strong to be restrained. I burned to say if but one word, by way of
      triumph, and to render doubly sure their assurance of my guiltlessness.
    &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
      “Gentlemen,” I said at last, as the party ascended the steps,
      “I delight to have allayed your suspicions. I wish you all health,
      and a little more courtesy. By the bye, gentlemen, this—this is a
      very well-constructed house.” (In the rabid desire to say something
      easily, I scarcely knew what I uttered at all.)—“I may say an
      &lt;i&gt;excellently&lt;/i&gt; well-constructed house. These walls—are you
      going, gentlemen?—these walls are solidly put together;” and
      here, through the mere phrenzy of bravado, I rapped heavily, with a cane
      which I held in my hand, upon that very portion of the brick-work behind
      which stood the corpse of the wife of my bosom.
    &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
      But may God shield and deliver me from the fangs of the Arch-Fiend! No
      sooner had the reverberation of my blows sunk into silence, than I was
      answered by a voice from within the tomb!—by a cry, at first muffled
      and broken, like the sobbing of a child, and then quickly swelling into
      one long, loud, and continuous scream, utterly anomalous and inhuman—a
      howl—a wailing shriek, half of horror and half of triumph, such as
      might have arisen only out of hell, conjointly from the throats of the
      damned in their agony and of the demons that exult in the damnation.
    &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
      Of my own thoughts it is folly to speak. Swooning, I staggered to the
      opposite wall. For one instant the party upon the stairs remained
      motionless, through extremity of terror and of awe. In the next, a dozen
      stout arms were toiling at the wall. It fell bodily. The corpse, already
      greatly decayed and clotted with gore, stood erect before the eyes of the
      spectators. Upon its head, with red extended mouth and solitary eye of
      fire, sat the hideous beast whose craft had seduced me into murder, and
      whose informing voice had consigned me to the hangman. I had walled the
      monster up within the tomb!

&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
      During the whole of a dull, dark, and soundless day in the autumn of the
      year, when the clouds hung oppressively low in the heavens, I had been
      passing alone, on horseback, through a singularly dreary tract of country;
      and at length found myself, as the shades of the evening drew on, within
      view of the melancholy House of Usher. I know not how it was—but,
      with the first glimpse of the building, a sense of insufferable gloom
      pervaded my spirit. I say insufferable; for the feeling was unrelieved by
      any of that half-pleasurable, because poetic, sentiment, with which the
      mind usually receives even the sternest natural images of the desolate or
      terrible. I looked upon the scene before me—upon the mere house, and
      the simple landscape features of the domain—upon the bleak walls—upon
      the vacant eye-like windows—upon a few rank sedges—and upon a
      few white trunks of decayed trees—with an utter depression of soul
      which I can compare to no earthly sensation more properly than to the
      after-dream of the reveller upon opium—the bitter lapse into
      everyday life—the hideous dropping off of the veil. There was an
      iciness, a sinking, a sickening of the heart—an unredeemed
      dreariness of thought which no goading of the imagination could torture
      into aught of the sublime. What was it—I paused to think—what
      was it that so unnerved me in the contemplation of the House of Usher? It
      was a mystery all insoluble; nor could I grapple with the shadowy fancies
      that crowded upon me as I pondered. I was forced to fall back upon the
      unsatisfactory conclusion, that while, beyond doubt, there &lt;i&gt;are&lt;/i&gt;
      combinations of very simple natural objects which have the power of thus
      affecting us, still the analysis of this power lies among considerations
      beyond our depth. It was possible, I reflected, that a mere different
      arrangement of the particulars of the scene, of the details of the
      picture, would be sufficient to modify, or perhaps to annihilate its
      capacity for sorrowful impression; and, acting upon this idea, I reined my
      horse to the precipitous brink of a black and lurid tarn that lay in
      unruffled lustre by the dwelling, and gazed down—but with a shudder
      even more thrilling than before—upon the remodelled and inverted
      images of the gray sedge, and the ghastly tree-stems, and the vacant and
      eye-like windows.
    &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
      Nevertheless, in this mansion of gloom I now proposed to myself a sojourn
      of some weeks. Its proprietor, Roderick Usher, had been one of my boon
      companions in boyhood; but many years had elapsed since our last meeting.
      A letter, however, had lately reached me in a distant part of the country—a
      letter from him—which, in its wildly importunate nature, had
      admitted of no other than a personal reply. The MS. gave evidence of
      nervous agitation. The writer spoke of acute bodily illness—of a
      mental disorder which oppressed him—and of an earnest desire to see
      me, as his best, and indeed his only personal friend, with a view of
      attempting, by the cheerfulness of my society, some alleviation of his
      malady. It was the manner in which all this, and much more, was said—it
      was the apparent &lt;i&gt;heart&lt;/i&gt; that went with his request—which
      allowed me no room for hesitation; and I accordingly obeyed forthwith what
      I still considered a very singular summons.
    &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
      Although, as boys, we had been even intimate associates, yet I really knew
      little of my friend. His reserve had been always excessive and habitual. I
      was aware, however, that his very ancient family had been noted, time out
      of mind, for a peculiar sensibility of temperament, displaying itself,
      through long ages, in many works of exalted art, and manifested, of late,
      in repeated deeds of munificent yet unobtrusive charity, as well as in a
      passionate devotion to the intricacies, perhaps even more than to the
      orthodox and easily recognisable beauties, of musical science. I had
      learned, too, the very remarkable fact, that the stem of the Usher race,
      all time-honored as it was, had put forth, at no period, any enduring
      branch; in other words, that the entire family lay in the direct line of
      descent, and had always, with very trifling and very temporary variation,
      so lain. It was this deficiency, I considered, while running over in
      thought the perfect keeping of the character of the premises with the
      accredited character of the people, and while speculating upon the
      possible influence which the one, in the long lapse of centuries, might
      have exercised upon the other—it was this deficiency, perhaps, of
      collateral issue, and the consequent undeviating transmission, from sire
      to son, of the patrimony with the name, which had, at length, so
      identified the two as to merge the original title of the estate in the
      quaint and equivocal appellation of the “House of Usher”—an
      appellation which seemed to include, in the minds of the peasantry who
      used it, both the family and the family mansion.
    &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
      I have said that the sole effect of my somewhat childish experiment—that
      of looking down within the tarn—had been to deepen the first
      singular impression. There can be no doubt that the consciousness of the
      rapid increase of my superstition—for why should I not so term it?—served
      mainly to accelerate the increase itself. Such, I have long known, is the
      paradoxical law of all sentiments having terror as a basis. And it might
      have been for this reason only, that, when I again uplifted my eyes to the
      house itself, from its image in the pool, there grew in my mind a strange
      fancy—a fancy so ridiculous, indeed, that I but mention it to show
      the vivid force of the sensations which oppressed me. I had so worked upon
      my imagination as really to believe that about the whole mansion and
      domain there hung an atmosphere peculiar to themselves and their immediate
      vicinity—an atmosphere which had no affinity with the air of heaven,
      but which had reeked up from the decayed trees, and the gray wall, and the
      silent tarn—a pestilent and mystic vapor, dull, sluggish, faintly
      discernible, and leaden-hued.
    &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
      Shaking off from my spirit what &lt;i&gt;must&lt;/i&gt; have been a dream, I scanned
      more narrowly the real aspect of the building. Its principal feature
      seemed to be that of an excessive antiquity. The discoloration of ages had
      been great. Minute fungi overspread the whole exterior, hanging in a fine
      tangled web-work from the eaves. Yet all this was apart from any
      extraordinary dilapidation. No portion of the masonry had fallen; and
      there appeared to be a wild inconsistency between its still perfect
      adaptation of parts, and the crumbling condition of the individual stones.
      In this there was much that reminded me of the specious totality of old
      wood-work which has rotted for long years in some neglected vault, with no
      disturbance from the breath of the external air. Beyond this indication of
      extensive decay, however, the fabric gave little token of instability.
      Perhaps the eye of a scrutinizing observer might have discovered a barely
      perceptible fissure, which, extending from the roof of the building in
      front, made its way down the wall in a zigzag direction, until it became
      lost in the sullen waters of the tarn.
    &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
      Noticing these things, I rode over a short causeway to the house. A
      servant in waiting took my horse, and I entered the Gothic archway of the
      hall. A valet, of stealthy step, thence conducted me, in silence, through
      many dark and intricate passages in my progress to the &lt;i&gt;studio&lt;/i&gt; of
      his master. Much that I encountered on the way contributed, I know not
      how, to heighten the vague sentiments of which I have already spoken.
      While the objects around me—while the carvings of the ceilings, the
      sombre tapestries of the walls, the ebon blackness of the floors, and the
      phantasmagoric armorial trophies which rattled as I strode, were but
      matters to which, or to such as which, I had been accustomed from my
      infancy—while I hesitated not to acknowledge how familiar was all
      this—I still wondered to find how unfamiliar were the fancies which
      ordinary images were stirring up. On one of the staircases, I met the
      physician of the family. His countenance, I thought, wore a mingled
      expression of low cunning and perplexity. He accosted me with trepidation
      and passed on. The valet now threw open a door and ushered me into the
      presence of his master.
    &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
      The room in which I found myself was very large and lofty. The windows
      were long, narrow, and pointed, and at so vast a distance from the black
      oaken floor as to be altogether inaccessible from within. Feeble gleams of
      encrimsoned light made their way through the trellissed panes, and served
      to render sufficiently distinct the more prominent objects around; the
      eye, however, struggled in vain to reach the remoter angles of the
      chamber, or the recesses of the vaulted and fretted ceiling. Dark
      draperies hung upon the walls. The general furniture was profuse,
      comfortless, antique, and tattered. Many books and musical instruments lay
      scattered about, but failed to give any vitality to the scene. I felt that
      I breathed an atmosphere of sorrow. An air of stern, deep, and
      irredeemable gloom hung over and pervaded all.
    &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
      Upon my entrance, Usher arose from a sofa on which he had been lying at
      full length, and greeted me with a vivacious warmth which had much in it,
      I at first thought, of an overdone cordiality—of the constrained
      effort of the &lt;i&gt;ennuyé&lt;/i&gt; man of the world. A glance, however, at his
      countenance, convinced me of his perfect sincerity. We sat down; and for
      some moments, while he spoke not, I gazed upon him with a feeling half of
      pity, half of awe. Surely, man had never before so terribly altered, in so
      brief a period, as had Roderick Usher! It was with difficulty that I could
      bring myself to admit the identity of the wan being before me with the
      companion of my early boyhood. Yet the character of his face had been at
      all times remarkable. A cadaverousness of complexion; an eye large,
      liquid, and luminous beyond comparison; lips somewhat thin and very
      pallid, but of a surpassingly beautiful curve; a nose of a delicate Hebrew
      model, but with a breadth of nostril unusual in similar formations; a
      finely moulded chin, speaking, in its want of prominence, of a want of
      moral energy; hair of a more than web-like softness and tenuity; these
      features, with an inordinate expansion above the regions of the temple,
      made up altogether a countenance not easily to be forgotten. And now in
      the mere exaggeration of the prevailing character of these features, and
      of the expression they were wont to convey, lay so much of change that I
      doubted to whom I spoke. The now ghastly pallor of the skin, and the now
      miraculous lustre of the eye, above all things startled and even awed me.
      The silken hair, too, had been suffered to grow all unheeded, and as, in
      its wild gossamer texture, it floated rather than fell about the face, I
      could not, even with effort, connect its Arabesque expression with any
      idea of simple humanity.
    &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
      In the manner of my friend I was at once struck with an incoherence—an
      inconsistency; and I soon found this to arise from a series of feeble and
      futile struggles to overcome an habitual trepidancy—an excessive
      nervous agitation. For something of this nature I had indeed been
      prepared, no less by his letter, than by reminiscences of certain boyish
      traits, and by conclusions deduced from his peculiar physical conformation
      and temperament. His action was alternately vivacious and sullen. His
      voice varied rapidly from a tremulous indecision (when the animal spirits
      seemed utterly in abeyance) to that species of energetic concision—that
      abrupt, weighty, unhurried, and hollow-sounding enunciation—that
      leaden, self-balanced and perfectly modulated guttural utterance, which
      may be observed in the lost drunkard, or the irreclaimable eater of opium,
      during the periods of his most intense excitement.
    &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
      It was thus that he spoke of the object of my visit, of his earnest desire
      to see me, and of the solace he expected me to afford him. He entered, at
      some length, into what he conceived to be the nature of his malady. It
      was, he said, a constitutional and a family evil, and one for which he
      despaired to find a remedy—a mere nervous affection, he immediately
      added, which would undoubtedly soon pass off. It displayed itself in a
      host of unnatural sensations. Some of these, as he detailed them,
      interested and bewildered me; although, perhaps, the terms, and the
      general manner of the narration had their weight. He suffered much from a
      morbid acuteness of the senses; the most insipid food was alone endurable;
      he could wear only garments of certain texture; the odors of all flowers
      were oppressive; his eyes were tortured by even a faint light; and there
      were but peculiar sounds, and these from stringed instruments, which did
      not inspire him with horror.
    &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
      To an anomalous species of terror I found him a bounden slave. “I shall
      perish,” said he, “I must perish in this deplorable folly. Thus, thus, and
      not otherwise, shall I be lost. I dread the events of the future, not in
      themselves, but in their results. I shudder at the thought of any, even
      the most trivial, incident, which may operate upon this intolerable
      agitation of soul. I have, indeed, no abhorrence of danger, except in its
      absolute effect—in terror. In this unnerved—in this pitiable
      condition—I feel that the period will sooner or later arrive when I
      must abandon life and reason together, in some struggle with the grim
      phantasm, FEAR.”
     &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
      I learned, moreover, at intervals, and through broken and equivocal hints,
      another singular feature of his mental condition. He was enchained by
      certain superstitious impressions in regard to the dwelling which he
      tenanted, and whence, for many years, he had never ventured forth—in
      regard to an influence whose supposititious force was conveyed in terms
      too shadowy here to be re-stated—an influence which some
      peculiarities in the mere form and substance of his family mansion, had,
      by dint of long sufferance, he said, obtained over his spirit—an
      effect which the &lt;i&gt;physique&lt;/i&gt; of the gray walls and turrets, and of the
      dim tarn into which they all looked down, had, at length, brought about
      upon the &lt;i&gt;morale&lt;/i&gt; of his existence.
    &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
      He admitted, however, although with hesitation, that much of the peculiar
      gloom which thus afflicted him could be traced to a more natural and far
      more palpable origin—to the severe and long-continued illness—indeed
      to the evidently approaching dissolution—of a tenderly beloved
      sister—his sole companion for long years—his last and only
      relative on earth. “Her decease,” he said, with a bitterness which I can
      never forget, “would leave him (him the hopeless and the frail) the last
      of the ancient race of the Ushers.” While he spoke, the lady Madeline (for
      so was she called) passed slowly through a remote portion of the
      apartment, and, without having noticed my presence, disappeared. I
      regarded her with an utter astonishment not unmingled with dread—and
      yet I found it impossible to account for such feelings. A sensation of
      stupor oppressed me, as my eyes followed her retreating steps. When a
      door, at length, closed upon her, my glance sought instinctively and
      eagerly the countenance of the brother—but he had buried his face in
      his hands, and I could only perceive that a far more than ordinary wanness
      had overspread the emaciated fingers through which trickled many
      passionate tears.
    &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
      The disease of the lady Madeline had long baffled the skill of her
      physicians. A settled apathy, a gradual wasting away of the person, and
      frequent although transient affections of a partially cataleptical
      character, were the unusual diagnosis. Hitherto she had steadily borne up
      against the pressure of her malady, and had not betaken herself finally to
      bed; but, on the closing in of the evening of my arrival at the house, she
      succumbed (as her brother told me at night with inexpressible agitation)
      to the prostrating power of the destroyer; and I learned that the glimpse
      I had obtained of her person would thus probably be the last I should
      obtain—that the lady, at least while living, would be seen by me no
      more.
    &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
      For several days ensuing, her name was unmentioned by either Usher or
      myself; and during this period I was busied in earnest endeavors to
      alleviate the melancholy of my friend. We painted and read together; or I
      listened, as if in a dream, to the wild improvisations of his speaking
      guitar. And thus, as a closer and still closer intimacy admitted me more
      unreservedly into the recesses of his spirit, the more bitterly did I
      perceive the futility of all attempt at cheering a mind from which
      darkness, as if an inherent positive quality, poured forth upon all
      objects of the moral and physical universe, in one unceasing radiation of
      gloom.
    &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
      I shall ever bear about me a memory of the many solemn hours I thus spent
      alone with the master of the House of Usher. Yet I should fail in any
      attempt to convey an idea of the exact character of the studies, or of the
      occupations, in which he involved me, or led me the way. An excited and
      highly distempered ideality threw a sulphureous lustre over all. His long
      improvised dirges will ring forever in my ears. Among other things, I hold
      painfully in mind a certain singular perversion and amplification of the
      wild air of the last waltz of Von Weber. From the paintings over which his
      elaborate fancy brooded, and which grew, touch by touch, into vaguenesses
      at which I shuddered the more thrillingly, because I shuddered knowing not
      why—from these paintings (vivid as their images now are before me)
      I would in vain endeavor to educe more than a small portion which should
      lie within the compass of merely written words. By the utter simplicity,
      by the nakedness of his designs, he arrested and overawed attention. If
      ever mortal painted an idea, that mortal was Roderick Usher. For me at
      least—in the circumstances then surrounding me—there arose out
      of the pure abstractions which the hypochondriac contrived to throw upon
      his canvass, an intensity of intolerable awe, no shadow of which felt I
      ever yet in the contemplation of the certainly glowing yet too concrete
      reveries of Fuseli.
    &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
      One of the phantasmagoric conceptions of my friend, partaking not so
      rigidly of the spirit of abstraction, may be shadowed forth, although
      feebly, in words. A small picture presented the interior of an immensely
      long and rectangular vault or tunnel, with low walls, smooth, white, and
      without interruption or device. Certain accessory points of the design
      served well to convey the idea that this excavation lay at an exceeding
      depth below the surface of the earth. No outlet was observed in any
      portion of its vast extent, and no torch, or other artificial source of
      light was discernible; yet a flood of intense rays rolled throughout, and
      bathed the whole in a ghastly and inappropriate splendor.
    &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
      I have just spoken of that morbid condition of the auditory nerve which
      rendered all music intolerable to the sufferer, with the exception of
      certain effects of stringed instruments. It was, perhaps, the narrow
      limits to which he thus confined himself upon the guitar, which gave
      birth, in great measure, to the fantastic character of his performances.
      But the fervid &lt;i&gt;facility&lt;/i&gt; of his &lt;i&gt;impromptus&lt;/i&gt; could not be so
      accounted for. They must have been, and were, in the notes, as well as in
      the words of his wild fantasias (for he not unfrequently accompanied
      himself with rhymed verbal improvisations), the result of that intense
      mental collectedness and concentration to which I have previously alluded
      as observable only in particular moments of the highest artificial
      excitement. The words of one of these rhapsodies I have easily remembered.
      I was, perhaps, the more forcibly impressed with it, as he gave it,
      because, in the under or mystic current of its meaning, I fancied that I
      perceived, and for the first time, a full consciousness on the part of
      Usher of the tottering of his lofty reason upon her throne. The verses,
      which were entitled “The Haunted Palace,” ran very nearly, if not
      accurately, thus:
    &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&#34;poem&#34;&gt;
                        I.&lt;br/&gt;
     In the greenest of our valleys,&lt;br/&gt;
    By good angels tenanted,&lt;br/&gt;
     Once a fair and stately palace—&lt;br/&gt;
    Radiant palace—reared its head.&lt;br/&gt;
     In the monarch Thought’s dominion—&lt;br/&gt;
    It stood there!&lt;br/&gt;
     Never seraph spread a pinion&lt;br/&gt;
    Over fabric half so fair.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;
                        II.&lt;br/&gt;
     Banners yellow, glorious, golden,&lt;br/&gt;
    On its roof did float and flow;&lt;br/&gt;
     (This—all this—was in the olden&lt;br/&gt;
    Time long ago)&lt;br/&gt;
     And every gentle air that dallied,&lt;br/&gt;
    In that sweet day,&lt;br/&gt;
     Along the ramparts plumed and pallid,&lt;br/&gt;
    A winged odor went away.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;
                        III.&lt;br/&gt;
     Wanderers in that happy valley&lt;br/&gt;
    Through two luminous windows saw&lt;br/&gt;
     Spirits moving musically&lt;br/&gt;
    To a lute’s well-tunéd law,&lt;br/&gt;
     Round about a throne, where sitting&lt;br/&gt;
    (Porphyrogene!)&lt;br/&gt;
     In state his glory well befitting,&lt;br/&gt;
    The ruler of the realm was seen.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;
                        IV.&lt;br/&gt;
     And all with pearl and ruby glowing&lt;br/&gt;
    Was the fair palace door,&lt;br/&gt;
     Through which came flowing, flowing, flowing,&lt;br/&gt;
    And sparkling evermore,&lt;br/&gt;
     A troop of Echoes whose sweet duty&lt;br/&gt;
    Was but to sing,&lt;br/&gt;
     In voices of surpassing beauty,&lt;br/&gt;
    The wit and wisdom of their king.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;
                        V.&lt;br/&gt;
     But evil things, in robes of sorrow,&lt;br/&gt;
    Assailed the monarch’s high estate;&lt;br/&gt;
     (Ah, let us mourn, for never morrow&lt;br/&gt;
    Shall dawn upon him, desolate!)&lt;br/&gt;
     And, round about his home, the glory&lt;br/&gt;
    That blushed and bloomed&lt;br/&gt;
     Is but a dim-remembered story&lt;br/&gt;
    Of the old time entombed.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;
                        VI.&lt;br/&gt;
     And travellers now within that valley,&lt;br/&gt;
    Through the red-litten windows, see&lt;br/&gt;
     Vast forms that move fantastically&lt;br/&gt;
    To a discordant melody;&lt;br/&gt;
     While, like a rapid ghastly river,&lt;br/&gt;
    Through the pale door,&lt;br/&gt;
     A hideous throng rush out forever,&lt;br/&gt;
    And laugh—but smile no more.&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
      I well remember that suggestions arising from this ballad, led us into a
      train of thought wherein there became manifest an opinion of Usher’s which
      I mention not so much on account of its novelty, (for other men * have
      thought thus,) as on account of the pertinacity with which he maintained
      it. This opinion, in its general form, was that of the sentience of all
      vegetable things. But, in his disordered fancy, the idea had assumed a
      more daring character, and trespassed, under certain conditions, upon the
      kingdom of inorganization. I lack words to express the full extent, or the
      earnest &lt;i&gt;abandon&lt;/i&gt; of his persuasion. The belief, however, was
      connected (as I have previously hinted) with the gray stones of the home
      of his forefathers. The conditions of the sentience had been here, he
      imagined, fulfilled in the method of collocation of these stones—in
      the order of their arrangement, as well as in that of the many &lt;i&gt;fungi&lt;/i&gt;
      which overspread them, and of the decayed trees which stood around—above
      all, in the long undisturbed endurance of this arrangement, and in its
      reduplication in the still waters of the tarn. Its evidence—the
      evidence of the sentience—was to be seen, he said, (and I here
      started as he spoke,) in the gradual yet certain condensation of an
      atmosphere of their own about the waters and the walls. The result was
      discoverable, he added, in that silent, yet importunate and terrible
      influence which for centuries had moulded the destinies of his family, and
      which made &lt;i&gt;him&lt;/i&gt; what I now saw him—what he was. Such opinions
      need no comment, and I will make none.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
      Our books—the books which, for years, had formed no small portion of
      the mental existence of the invalid—were, as might be supposed, in
      strict keeping with this character of phantasm. We pored together over
      such works as the Ververt et Chartreuse of Gresset; the Belphegor of
      Machiavelli; the Heaven and Hell of Swedenborg; the Subterranean Voyage of
      Nicholas Klimm by Holberg; the Chiromancy of Robert Flud, of Jean
      D’Indaginé, and of De la Chambre; the Journey into the Blue Distance of
      Tieck; and the City of the Sun of Campanella. One favorite volume was a
      small octavo edition of the &lt;i&gt;Directorium Inquisitorium&lt;/i&gt;, by the
      Dominican Eymeric de Gironne; and there were passages in Pomponius Mela,
      about the old African Satyrs and OEgipans, over which Usher would sit
      dreaming for hours. His chief delight, however, was found in the perusal
      of an exceedingly rare and curious book in quarto Gothic—the manual
      of a forgotten church—the &lt;i&gt;Vigiliae Mortuorum secundum Chorum
      Ecclesiae Maguntinae&lt;/i&gt;.
    &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
      I could not help thinking of the wild ritual of this work, and of its
      probable influence upon the hypochondriac, when, one evening, having
      informed me abruptly that the lady Madeline was no more, he stated his
      intention of preserving her corpse for a fortnight, (previously to its
      final interment,) in one of the numerous vaults within the main walls of
      the building. The worldly reason, however, assigned for this singular
      proceeding, was one which I did not feel at liberty to dispute. The
      brother had been led to his resolution (so he told me) by consideration of
      the unusual character of the malady of the deceased, of certain obtrusive
      and eager inquiries on the part of her medical men, and of the remote and
      exposed situation of the burial-ground of the family. I will not deny that
      when I called to mind the sinister countenance of the person whom I met
      upon the staircase, on the day of my arrival at the house, I had no desire
      to oppose what I regarded as at best but a harmless, and by no means an
      unnatural, precaution.
    &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
      At the request of Usher, I personally aided him in the arrangements for
      the temporary entombment. The body having been encoffined, we two alone
      bore it to its rest. The vault in which we placed it (and which had been
      so long unopened that our torches, half smothered in its oppressive
      atmosphere, gave us little opportunity for investigation) was small, damp,
      and entirely without means of admission for light; lying, at great depth,
      immediately beneath that portion of the building in which was my own
      sleeping apartment. It had been used, apparently, in remote feudal times,
      for the worst purposes of a donjon-keep, and, in later days, as a place of
      deposit for powder, or some other highly combustible substance, as a
      portion of its floor, and the whole interior of a long archway through
      which we reached it, were carefully sheathed with copper. The door, of
      massive iron, had been, also, similarly protected. Its immense weight
      caused an unusually sharp grating sound, as it moved upon its hinges.
    &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
      Having deposited our mournful burden upon tressels within this region of
      horror, we partially turned aside the yet unscrewed lid of the coffin, and
      looked upon the face of the tenant. A striking similitude between the
      brother and sister now first arrested my attention; and Usher, divining,
      perhaps, my thoughts, murmured out some few words from which I learned
      that the deceased and himself had been twins, and that sympathies of a
      scarcely intelligible nature had always existed between them. Our glances,
      however, rested not long upon the dead—for we could not regard her
      unawed. The disease which had thus entombed the lady in the maturity of
      youth, had left, as usual in all maladies of a strictly cataleptical
      character, the mockery of a faint blush upon the bosom and the face, and
      that suspiciously lingering smile upon the lip which is so terrible in
      death. We replaced and screwed down the lid, and, having secured the door
      of iron, made our way, with toil, into the scarcely less gloomy apartments
      of the upper portion of the house.
    &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
      And now, some days of bitter grief having elapsed, an observable change
      came over the features of the mental disorder of my friend. His ordinary
      manner had vanished. His ordinary occupations were neglected or forgotten.
      He roamed from chamber to chamber with hurried, unequal, and objectless
      step. The pallor of his countenance had assumed, if possible, a more
      ghastly hue—but the luminousness of his eye had utterly gone out.
      The once occasional huskiness of his tone was heard no more; and a
      tremulous quaver, as if of extreme terror, habitually characterized his
      utterance. There were times, indeed, when I thought his unceasingly
      agitated mind was laboring with some oppressive secret, to divulge which
      he struggled for the necessary courage. At times, again, I was obliged to
      resolve all into the mere inexplicable vagaries of madness, for I beheld
      him gazing upon vacancy for long hours, in an attitude of the profoundest
      attention, as if listening to some imaginary sound. It was no wonder that
      his condition terrified—that it infected me. I felt creeping upon
      me, by slow yet certain degrees, the wild influences of his own fantastic
      yet impressive superstitions.
    &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
      It was, especially, upon retiring to bed late in the night of the seventh
      or eighth day after the placing of the lady Madeline within the donjon,
      that I experienced the full power of such feelings. Sleep came not near my
      couch—while the hours waned and waned away. I struggled to reason
      off the nervousness which had dominion over me. I endeavored to believe
      that much, if not all of what I felt, was due to the bewildering influence
      of the gloomy furniture of the room—of the dark and tattered
      draperies, which, tortured into motion by the breath of a rising tempest,
      swayed fitfully to and fro upon the walls, and rustled uneasily about the
      decorations of the bed. But my efforts were fruitless. An irrepressible
      tremor gradually pervaded my frame; and, at length, there sat upon my very
      heart an incubus of utterly causeless alarm. Shaking this off with a gasp
      and a struggle, I uplifted myself upon the pillows, and, peering earnestly
      within the intense darkness of the chamber, harkened—I know not why,
      except that an instinctive spirit prompted me—to certain low and
      indefinite sounds which came, through the pauses of the storm, at long
      intervals, I knew not whence. Overpowered by an intense sentiment of
      horror, unaccountable yet unendurable, I threw on my clothes with haste
      (for I felt that I should sleep no more during the night), and endeavored
      to arouse myself from the pitiable condition into which I had fallen, by
      pacing rapidly to and fro through the apartment.
    &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
      I had taken but few turns in this manner, when a light step on an
      adjoining staircase arrested my attention. I presently recognised it as
      that of Usher. In an instant afterward he rapped, with a gentle touch, at
      my door, and entered, bearing a lamp. His countenance was, as usual,
      cadaverously wan—but, moreover, there was a species of mad hilarity
      in his eyes—an evidently restrained &lt;i&gt;hysteria&lt;/i&gt; in his whole
      demeanor. His air appalled me—but anything was preferable to the
      solitude which I had so long endured, and I even welcomed his presence as
      a relief.
    &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
      “And you have not seen it?” he said abruptly, after having stared about
      him for some moments in silence—“you have not then seen it?—but,
      stay! you shall.” Thus speaking, and having carefully shaded his lamp, he
      hurried to one of the casements, and threw it freely open to the storm.
    &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
      The impetuous fury of the entering gust nearly lifted us from our feet. It
      was, indeed, a tempestuous yet sternly beautiful night, and one wildly
      singular in its terror and its beauty. A whirlwind had apparently
      collected its force in our vicinity; for there were frequent and violent
      alterations in the direction of the wind; and the exceeding density of the
      clouds (which hung so low as to press upon the turrets of the house) did
      not prevent our perceiving the life-like velocity with which they flew
      careering from all points against each other, without passing away into
      the distance. I say that even their exceeding density did not prevent our
      perceiving this—yet we had no glimpse of the moon or stars—nor
      was there any flashing forth of the lightning. But the under surfaces of
      the huge masses of agitated vapor, as well as all terrestrial objects
      immediately around us, were glowing in the unnatural light of a faintly
      luminous and distinctly visible gaseous exhalation which hung about and
      enshrouded the mansion.
    &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
      “You must not—you shall not behold this!” said I, shudderingly, to
      Usher, as I led him, with a gentle violence, from the window to a seat.
      “These appearances, which bewilder you, are merely electrical phenomena
      not uncommon—or it may be that they have their ghastly origin in the
      rank miasma of the tarn. Let us close this casement;—the air is
      chilling and dangerous to your frame. Here is one of your favorite
      romances. I will read, and you shall listen;—and so we will pass
      away this terrible night together.”
     &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
      The antique volume which I had taken up was the “Mad Trist” of Sir
      Launcelot Canning; but I had called it a favorite of Usher’s more in sad
      jest than in earnest; for, in truth, there is little in its uncouth and
      unimaginative prolixity which could have had interest for the lofty and
      spiritual ideality of my friend. It was, however, the only book
      immediately at hand; and I indulged a vague hope that the excitement which
      now agitated the hypochondriac, might find relief (for the history of
      mental disorder is full of similar anomalies) even in the extremeness of
      the folly which I should read. Could I have judged, indeed, by the wild
      overstrained air of vivacity with which he harkened, or apparently
      harkened, to the words of the tale, I might well have congratulated myself
      upon the success of my design.
    &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
      I had arrived at that well-known portion of the story where Ethelred, the
      hero of the Trist, having sought in vain for peaceable admission into the
      dwelling of the hermit, proceeds to make good an entrance by force. Here,
      it will be remembered, the words of the narrative run thus:
    &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
      “And Ethelred, who was by nature of a doughty heart, and who was now
      mighty withal, on account of the powerfulness of the wine which he had
      drunken, waited no longer to hold parley with the hermit, who, in sooth,
      was of an obstinate and maliceful turn, but, feeling the rain upon his
      shoulders, and fearing the rising of the tempest, uplifted his mace
      outright, and, with blows, made quickly room in the plankings of the door
      for his gauntleted hand; and now pulling therewith sturdily, he so
      cracked, and ripped, and tore all asunder, that the noise of the dry and
      hollow-sounding wood alarummed and reverberated throughout the forest.”
     &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
      At the termination of this sentence I started, and for a moment, paused;
      for it appeared to me (although I at once concluded that my excited fancy
      had deceived me)—it appeared to me that, from some very remote
      portion of the mansion, there came, indistinctly, to my ears, what might
      have been, in its exact similarity of character, the echo (but a stifled
      and dull one certainly) of the very cracking and ripping sound which Sir
      Launcelot had so particularly described. It was, beyond doubt, the
      coincidence alone which had arrested my attention; for, amid the rattling
      of the sashes of the casements, and the ordinary commingled noises of the
      still increasing storm, the sound, in itself, had nothing, surely, which
      should have interested or disturbed me. I continued the story:
    &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
      “But the good champion Ethelred, now entering within the door, was sore
      enraged and amazed to perceive no signal of the maliceful hermit; but, in
      the stead thereof, a dragon of a scaly and prodigious demeanor, and of a
      fiery tongue, which sate in guard before a palace of gold, with a floor of
      silver; and upon the wall there hung a shield of shining brass with this
      legend enwritten—
    &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&#34;poem&#34;&gt;
     Who entereth herein, a conqueror hath bin;&lt;br/&gt;
     Who slayeth the dragon, the shield he shall win;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
      And Ethelred uplifted his mace, and struck upon the head of the dragon,
      which fell before him, and gave up his pesty breath, with a shriek so
      horrid and harsh, and withal so piercing, that Ethelred had fain to close
      his ears with his hands against the dreadful noise of it, the like whereof
      was never before heard.”
     &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
      Here again I paused abruptly, and now with a feeling of wild amazement—for
      there could be no doubt whatever that, in this instance, I did actually
      hear (although from what direction it proceeded I found it impossible to
      say) a low and apparently distant, but harsh, protracted, and most unusual
      screaming or grating sound—the exact counterpart of what my fancy
      had already conjured up for the dragon’s unnatural shriek as described by
      the romancer.
    &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
      Oppressed, as I certainly was, upon the occurrence of this second and most
      extraordinary coincidence, by a thousand conflicting sensations, in which
      wonder and extreme terror were predominant, I still retained sufficient
      presence of mind to avoid exciting, by any observation, the sensitive
      nervousness of my companion. I was by no means certain that he had noticed
      the sounds in question; although, assuredly, a strange alteration had,
      during the last few minutes, taken place in his demeanor. From a position
      fronting my own, he had gradually brought round his chair, so as to sit
      with his face to the door of the chamber; and thus I could but partially
      perceive his features, although I saw that his lips trembled as if he were
      murmuring inaudibly. His head had dropped upon his breast—yet I knew
      that he was not asleep, from the wide and rigid opening of the eye as I
      caught a glance of it in profile. The motion of his body, too, was at
      variance with this idea—for he rocked from side to side with a
      gentle yet constant and uniform sway. Having rapidly taken notice of all
      this, I resumed the narrative of Sir Launcelot, which thus proceeded:
    &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
      “And now, the champion, having escaped from the terrible fury of the
      dragon, bethinking himself of the brazen shield, and of the breaking up of
      the enchantment which was upon it, removed the carcass from out of the way
      before him, and approached valorously over the silver pavement of the
      castle to where the shield was upon the wall; which in sooth tarried not
      for his full coming, but fell down at his feet upon the silver floor, with
      a mighty great and terrible ringing sound.”
     &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
      No sooner had these syllables passed my lips, than—as if a shield of
      brass had indeed, at the moment, fallen heavily upon a floor of silver—I
      became aware of a distinct, hollow, metallic, and clangorous, yet
      apparently muffled reverberation. Completely unnerved, I leaped to my
      feet; but the measured rocking movement of Usher was undisturbed. I rushed
      to the chair in which he sat. His eyes were bent fixedly before him, and
      throughout his whole countenance there reigned a stony rigidity. But, as I
      placed my hand upon his shoulder, there came a strong shudder over his
      whole person; a sickly smile quivered about his lips; and I saw that he
      spoke in a low, hurried, and gibbering murmur, as if unconscious of my
      presence. Bending closely over him, I at length drank in the hideous
      import of his words.
    &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
      “Not hear it?—yes, I hear it, and &lt;i&gt;have&lt;/i&gt; heard it. Long—long—long—many
      minutes, many hours, many days, have I heard it—yet I dared not—oh,
      pity me, miserable wretch that I am!—I dared not—I &lt;i&gt;dared&lt;/i&gt;
      not speak! &lt;i&gt;We have put her living in the tomb!&lt;/i&gt; Said I not that my
      senses were acute? I &lt;i&gt;now&lt;/i&gt; tell you that I heard her first feeble
      movements in the hollow coffin. I heard them—many, many days ago—yet
      I dared not—&lt;i&gt;I dared not speak!&lt;/i&gt; And now—to-night—Ethelred—ha!
      ha!—the breaking of the hermit’s door, and the death-cry of the
      dragon, and the clangor of the shield!—say, rather, the rending of
      her coffin, and the grating of the iron hinges of her prison, and her
      struggles within the coppered archway of the vault! Oh whither shall I
      fly? Will she not be here anon? Is she not hurrying to upbraid me for my
      haste? Have I not heard her footstep on the stair? Do I not distinguish
      that heavy and horrible beating of her heart? Madman!”—here he
      sprang furiously to his feet, and shrieked out his syllables, as if in the
      effort he were giving up his soul—“&lt;i&gt;Madman! I tell you that she
      now stands without the door!&lt;/i&gt;”
     &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
      As if in the superhuman energy of his utterance there had been found the
      potency of a spell—the huge antique pannels to which the speaker
      pointed, threw slowly back, upon the instant, their ponderous and ebony
      jaws. It was the work of the rushing gust—but then without those
      doors there &lt;i&gt;did&lt;/i&gt; stand the lofty and enshrouded figure of the lady
      Madeline of Usher. There was blood upon her white robes, and the evidence
      of some bitter struggle upon every portion of her emaciated frame. For a
      moment she remained trembling and reeling to and fro upon the threshold—then,
      with a low moaning cry, fell heavily inward upon the person of her
      brother, and in her violent and now final death-agonies, bore him to the
      floor a corpse, and a victim to the terrors he had anticipated.
    &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
      From that chamber, and from that mansion, I fled aghast. The storm was
      still abroad in all its wrath as I found myself crossing the old causeway.
      Suddenly there shot along the path a wild light, and I turned to see
      whence a gleam so unusual could have issued; for the vast house and its
      shadows were alone behind me. The radiance was that of the full, setting,
      and blood-red moon, which now shone vividly through that once
      barely-discernible fissure, of which I have before spoken as extending
      from the roof of the building, in a zigzag direction, to the base. While I
      gazed, this fissure rapidly widened—there came a fierce breath of
      the whirlwind—the entire orb of the satellite burst at once upon my
      sight—my brain reeled as I saw the mighty walls rushing asunder—there
      was a long tumultuous shouting sound like the voice of a thousand waters—and
      the deep and dank tarn at my feet closed sullenly and silently over the
      fragments of the “&lt;i&gt;House of Usher&lt;/i&gt;.”
     &lt;/p&gt;

     “The mountain pinnacles slumber; valleys, crags and caves &lt;i&gt;are
     silent&lt;/i&gt;.”
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
      “Listen to me,” said the Demon as he placed his hand upon my head. “The
      region of which I speak is a dreary region in Libya, by the borders of the
      river Zaire. And there is no quiet there, nor silence.
    &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
      “The waters of the river have a saffron and sickly hue; and they flow not
      onwards to the sea, but palpitate forever and forever beneath the red eye
      of the sun with a tumultuous and convulsive motion. For many miles on
      either side of the river’s oozy bed is a pale desert of gigantic
      water-lilies. They sigh one unto the other in that solitude, and stretch
      towards the heaven their long and ghastly necks, and nod to and fro their
      everlasting heads. And there is an indistinct murmur which cometh out from
      among them like the rushing of subterrene water. And they sigh one unto
      the other.
    &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
      “But there is a boundary to their realm—the boundary of the dark,
      horrible, lofty forest. There, like the waves about the Hebrides, the low
      underwood is agitated continually. But there is no wind throughout the
      heaven. And the tall primeval trees rock eternally hither and thither with
      a crashing and mighty sound. And from their high summits, one by one, drop
      everlasting dews. And at the roots strange poisonous flowers lie writhing
      in perturbed slumber. And overhead, with a rustling and loud noise, the
      gray clouds rush westwardly forever, until they roll, a cataract, over the
      fiery wall of the horizon. But there is no wind throughout the heaven. And
      by the shores of the river Zaire there is neither quiet nor silence.
    &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
      “It was night, and the rain fell; and falling, it was rain, but, having
      fallen, it was blood. And I stood in the morass among the tall and the
      rain fell upon my head—and the lilies sighed one unto the other in
      the solemnity of their desolation.
    &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
      “And, all at once, the moon arose through the thin ghastly mist, and was
      crimson in color. And mine eyes fell upon a huge gray rock which stood by
      the shore of the river, and was lighted by the light of the moon. And the
      rock was gray, and ghastly, and tall,—and the rock was gray. Upon
      its front were characters engraven in the stone; and I walked through the
      morass of water-lilies, until I came close unto the shore, that I might
      read the characters upon the stone. But I could not decypher them. And I
      was going back into the morass, when the moon shone with a fuller red, and
      I turned and looked again upon the rock, and upon the characters, and
      the characters were &lt;small&gt;DESOLATION&lt;/small&gt;.
    &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
      “And I looked upwards, and there stood a man upon the summit of the rock;
      and I hid myself among the water-lilies that I might discover the actions
      of the man. And the man was tall and stately in form, and was wrapped up
      from his shoulders to his feet in the toga of old Rome. And the outlines
      of his figure were indistinct—but his features were the features of
      a deity; for the mantle of the night, and of the mist, and of the moon,
      and of the dew, had left uncovered the features of his face. And his brow
      was lofty with thought, and his eye wild with care; and, in the few
      furrows upon his cheek I read the fables of sorrow, and weariness, and
      disgust with mankind, and a longing after solitude.
    &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
      “And the man sat upon the rock, and leaned his head upon his hand, and
      looked out upon the desolation. He looked down into the low unquiet
      shrubbery, and up into the tall primeval trees, and up higher at the
      rustling heaven, and into the crimson moon. And I lay close within shelter
      of the lilies, and observed the actions of the man. And the man trembled
      in the solitude;—but the night waned, and he sat upon the rock.
    &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
      “And the man turned his attention from the heaven, and looked out upon the
      dreary river Zaire, and upon the yellow ghastly waters, and upon the pale
      legions of the water-lilies. And the man listened to the sighs of the
      water-lilies, and to the murmur that came up from among them. And I lay
      close within my covert and observed the actions of the man. And the man
      trembled in the solitude;—but the night waned and he sat upon the
      rock.
    &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
      “Then I went down into the recesses of the morass, and waded afar in among
      the wilderness of the lilies, and called unto the hippopotami which dwelt
      among the fens in the recesses of the morass. And the hippopotami heard my
      call, and came, with the behemoth, unto the foot of the rock, and roared
      loudly and fearfully beneath the moon. And I lay close within my covert
      and observed the actions of the man. And the man trembled in the solitude;—but
      the night waned and he sat upon the rock.
    &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
      “Then I cursed the elements with the curse of tumult; and a frightful
      tempest gathered in the heaven where, before, there had been no wind. And
      the heaven became livid with the violence of the tempest—and the
      rain beat upon the head of the man—and the floods of the river came
      down—and the river was tormented into foam—and the
      water-lilies shrieked within their beds—and the forest crumbled
      before the wind—and the thunder rolled—and the lightning fell—and
      the rock rocked to its foundation. And I lay close within my covert and
      observed the actions of the man. And the man trembled in the solitude;—but
      the night waned and he sat upon the rock.
    &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
      “Then I grew angry and cursed, with the curse of silence, the river, and
      the lilies, and the wind, and the forest, and the heaven, and the thunder,
      and the sighs of the water-lilies. And they became accursed, and were
      still. And the moon ceased to totter up its pathway to heaven—and
      the thunder died away—and the lightning did not flash—and the
      clouds hung motionless—and the waters sunk to their level and
      remained—and the trees ceased to rock—and the water-lilies
      sighed no more—and the murmur was heard no longer from among them,
      nor any shadow of sound throughout the vast illimitable desert. And I
      looked upon the characters of the rock, and they were changed; and
      the characters were &lt;small&gt;SILENCE&lt;/small&gt;.
    &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
      “And mine eyes fell upon the countenance of the man, and his countenance
      was wan with terror. And, hurriedly, he raised his head from his hand, and
      stood forth upon the rock and listened. But there was no voice throughout
      the vast illimitable desert, and the characters upon the rock were
      &lt;small&gt;SILENCE&lt;/small&gt;. And the man shuddered, and turned his face away, and fled afar
      off, in haste, so that I beheld him no more.”
     &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;hr/&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
      Now there are fine tales in the volumes of the Magi—in the
      iron-bound, melancholy volumes of the Magi. Therein, I say, are glorious
      histories of the Heaven, and of the Earth, and of the mighty sea—and
      of the Genii that over-ruled the sea, and the earth, and the lofty heaven.
      There was much lore too in the sayings which were said by the Sybils; and
      holy, holy things were heard of old by the dim leaves that trembled around
      Dodona—but, as Allah liveth, that fable which the Demon told me as
      he sat by my side in the shadow of the tomb, I hold to be the most
      wonderful of all! And as the Demon made an end of his story, he fell back
      within the cavity of the tomb and laughed. And I could not laugh with the
      Demon, and he cursed me because I could not laugh. And the lynx which
      dwelleth forever in the tomb, came out therefrom, and lay down at the feet
      of the Demon, and looked at him steadily in the face.

&lt;h2&gt;&lt;a id=&#34;chap2.10&#34;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;THE MASQUE OF THE RED DEATH.&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
      The “Red Death” had long devastated the country. No pestilence had ever
      been so fatal, or so hideous. Blood was its Avatar and its seal—the
      redness and the horror of blood. There were sharp pains, and sudden
      dizziness, and then profuse bleeding at the pores, with dissolution. The
      scarlet stains upon the body and especially upon the face of the victim,
      were the pest ban which shut him out from the aid and from the sympathy of
      his fellow-men. And the whole seizure, progress and termination of the
      disease, were the incidents of half an hour.
    &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
      But the Prince Prospero was happy and dauntless and sagacious. When his
      dominions were half depopulated, he summoned to his presence a thousand
      hale and light-hearted friends from among the knights and dames of his
      court, and with these retired to the deep seclusion of one of his
      castellated abbeys. This was an extensive and magnificent structure, the
      creation of the prince’s own eccentric yet august taste. A strong and
      lofty wall girdled it in. This wall had gates of iron. The courtiers,
      having entered, brought furnaces and massy hammers and welded the bolts.
      They resolved to leave means neither of ingress or egress to the sudden
      impulses of despair or of frenzy from within. The abbey was amply
      provisioned. With such precautions the courtiers might bid defiance to
      contagion. The external world could take care of itself. In the meantime
      it was folly to grieve, or to think. The prince had provided all the
      appliances of pleasure. There were buffoons, there were improvisatori,
      there were ballet-dancers, there were musicians, there was Beauty, there
      was wine. All these and security were within. Without was the “Red Death.”
     &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
      It was toward the close of the fifth or sixth month of his seclusion, and
      while the pestilence raged most furiously abroad, that the Prince Prospero
      entertained his thousand friends at a masked ball of the most unusual
      magnificence.
    &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
      It was a voluptuous scene, that masquerade. But first let me tell of the
      rooms in which it was held. There were seven—an imperial suite. In
      many palaces, however, such suites form a long and straight vista, while
      the folding doors slide back nearly to the walls on either hand, so that
      the view of the whole extent is scarcely impeded. Here the case was very
      different; as might have been expected from the duke’s love of the
      bizarre. The apartments were so irregularly disposed that the vision
      embraced but little more than one at a time. There was a sharp turn at
      every twenty or thirty yards, and at each turn a novel effect. To the
      right and left, in the middle of each wall, a tall and narrow Gothic
      window looked out upon a closed corridor which pursued the windings of the
      suite. These windows were of stained glass whose color varied in
      accordance with the prevailing hue of the decorations of the chamber into
      which it opened. That at the eastern extremity was hung, for example, in
      blue—and vividly blue were its windows. The second chamber was
      purple in its ornaments and tapestries, and here the panes were purple.
      The third was green throughout, and so were the casements. The fourth was
      furnished and lighted with orange—the fifth with white—the
      sixth with violet. The seventh apartment was closely shrouded in black
      velvet tapestries that hung all over the ceiling and down the walls,
      falling in heavy folds upon a carpet of the same material and hue. But in
      this chamber only, the color of the windows failed to correspond with the
      decorations. The panes here were scarlet—a deep blood color. Now in
      no one of the seven apartments was there any lamp or candelabrum, amid the
      profusion of golden ornaments that lay scattered to and fro or depended
      from the roof. There was no light of any kind emanating from lamp or
      candle within the suite of chambers. But in the corridors that followed
      the suite, there stood, opposite to each window, a heavy tripod, bearing a
      brazier of fire that projected its rays through the tinted glass and so
      glaringly illumined the room. And thus were produced a multitude of gaudy
      and fantastic appearances. But in the western or black chamber the effect
      of the fire-light that streamed upon the dark hangings through the
      blood-tinted panes, was ghastly in the extreme, and produced so wild a
      look upon the countenances of those who entered, that there were few of
      the company bold enough to set foot within its precincts at all.
    &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
      It was in this apartment, also, that there stood against the western wall,
      a gigantic clock of ebony. Its pendulum swung to and fro with a dull,
      heavy, monotonous clang; and when the minute-hand made the circuit of the
      face, and the hour was to be stricken, there came from the brazen lungs of
      the clock a sound which was clear and loud and deep and exceedingly
      musical, but of so peculiar a note and emphasis that, at each lapse of an
      hour, the musicians of the orchestra were constrained to pause,
      momentarily, in their performance, to hearken to the sound; and thus the
      waltzers perforce ceased their evolutions; and there was a brief
      disconcert of the whole gay company; and, while the chimes of the clock
      yet rang, it was observed that the giddiest grew pale, and the more aged
      and sedate passed their hands over their brows as if in confused reverie
      or meditation. But when the echoes had fully ceased, a light laughter at
      once pervaded the assembly; the musicians looked at each other and smiled
      as if at their own nervousness and folly, and made whispering vows, each
      to the other, that the next chiming of the clock should produce in them no
      similar emotion; and then, after the lapse of sixty minutes (which
      embrace three thousand and six hundred seconds of the Time that flies),
      there came yet another chiming of the clock, and then were the same
      disconcert and tremulousness and meditation as before.
    &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
      But, in spite of these things, it was a gay and magnificent revel. The
      tastes of the duke were peculiar. He had a fine eye for colors and
      effects. He disregarded the decora of mere fashion. His plans were bold
      and fiery, and his conceptions glowed with barbaric lustre. There are some
      who would have thought him mad. His followers felt that he was not. It was
      necessary to hear and see and touch him to be sure that he was not.
    &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
      He had directed, in great part, the moveable embellishments of the seven
      chambers, upon occasion of this great fête; and it was his own guiding
      taste which had given character to the masqueraders. Be sure they were
      grotesque. There were much glare and glitter and piquancy and phantasm—much
      of what has been since seen in “Hernani.” There were arabesque figures
      with unsuited limbs and appointments. There were delirious fancies such as
      the madman fashions. There was much of the beautiful, much of the wanton,
      much of the bizarre, something of the terrible, and not a little of that
      which might have excited disgust. To and fro in the seven chambers there
      stalked, in fact, a multitude of dreams. And these—the dreams—writhed
      in and about, taking hue from the rooms, and causing the wild music of the
      orchestra to seem as the echo of their steps. And, anon, there strikes the
      ebony clock which stands in the hall of the velvet. And then, for a
      moment, all is still, and all is silent save the voice of the clock. The
      dreams are stiff-frozen as they stand. But the echoes of the chime die
      away—they have endured but an instant—and a light,
      half-subdued laughter floats after them as they depart. And now again the
      music swells, and the dreams live, and writhe to and fro more merrily than
      ever, taking hue from the many-tinted windows through which stream the
      rays from the tripods. But to the chamber which lies most westwardly of
      the seven, there are now none of the maskers who venture; for the night is
      waning away; and there flows a ruddier light through the blood-colored
      panes; and the blackness of the sable drapery appals; and to him whose
      foot falls upon the sable carpet, there comes from the near clock of ebony
      a muffled peal more solemnly emphatic than any which reaches their ears
      who indulge in the more remote gaieties of the other apartments.
    &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
      But these other apartments were densely crowded, and in them beat
      feverishly the heart of life. And the revel went whirlingly on, until at
      length there commenced the sounding of midnight upon the clock. And then
      the music ceased, as I have told; and the evolutions of the waltzers were
      quieted; and there was an uneasy cessation of all things as before. But
      now there were twelve strokes to be sounded by the bell of the clock; and
      thus it happened, perhaps, that more of thought crept, with more of time,
      into the meditations of the thoughtful among those who revelled. And thus,
      too, it happened, perhaps, that before the last echoes of the last chime
      had utterly sunk into silence, there were many individuals in the crowd
      who had found leisure to become aware of the presence of a masked figure
      which had arrested the attention of no single individual before. And the
      rumor of this new presence having spread itself whisperingly around, there
      arose at length from the whole company a buzz, or murmur, expressive of
      disapprobation and surprise—then, finally, of terror, of horror, and
      of disgust.
    &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
      In an assembly of phantasms such as I have painted, it may well be
      supposed that no ordinary appearance could have excited such sensation. In
      truth the masquerade license of the night was nearly unlimited; but the
      figure in question had out-Heroded Herod, and gone beyond the bounds of
      even the prince’s indefinite decorum. There are chords in the hearts of
      the most reckless which cannot be touched without emotion. Even with the
      utterly lost, to whom life and death are equally jests, there are matters
      of which no jest can be made. The whole company, indeed, seemed now deeply
      to feel that in the costume and bearing of the stranger neither wit nor
      propriety existed. The figure was tall and gaunt, and shrouded from head
      to foot in the habiliments of the grave. The mask which concealed the
      visage was made so nearly to resemble the countenance of a stiffened
      corpse that the closest scrutiny must have had difficulty in detecting the
      cheat. And yet all this might have been endured, if not approved, by the
      mad revellers around. But the mummer had gone so far as to assume the type
      of the Red Death. His vesture was dabbled in blood—and his broad
      brow, with all the features of the face, was besprinkled with the scarlet
      horror.
    &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
      When the eyes of Prince Prospero fell upon this spectral image (which with
      a slow and solemn movement, as if more fully to sustain its role, stalked
      to and fro among the waltzers) he was seen to be convulsed, in the first
      moment with a strong shudder either of terror or distaste; but, in the
      next, his brow reddened with rage.
    &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
      “Who dares?” he demanded hoarsely of the courtiers who stood near him—“who
      dares insult us with this blasphemous mockery? Seize him and unmask him—that
      we may know whom we have to hang at sunrise, from the battlements!”
     &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
      It was in the eastern or blue chamber in which stood the Prince Prospero
      as he uttered these words. They rang throughout the seven rooms loudly and
      clearly—for the prince was a bold and robust man, and the music had
      become hushed at the waving of his hand.
    &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
      It was in the blue room where stood the prince, with a group of pale
      courtiers by his side. At first, as he spoke, there was a slight rushing
      movement of this group in the direction of the intruder, who at the moment
      was also near at hand, and now, with deliberate and stately step, made
      closer approach to the speaker. But from a certain nameless awe with which
      the mad assumptions of the mummer had inspired the whole party, there were
      found none who put forth hand to seize him; so that, unimpeded, he passed
      within a yard of the prince’s person; and, while the vast assembly, as if
      with one impulse, shrank from the centres of the rooms to the walls, he
      made his way uninterruptedly, but with the same solemn and measured step
      which had distinguished him from the first, through the blue chamber to
      the purple—through the purple to the green—through the green
      to the orange—through this again to the white—and even thence
      to the violet, ere a decided movement had been made to arrest him. It was
      then, however, that the Prince Prospero, maddening with rage and the shame
      of his own momentary cowardice, rushed hurriedly through the six chambers,
      while none followed him on account of a deadly terror that had seized upon
      all. He bore aloft a drawn dagger, and had approached, in rapid
      impetuosity, to within three or four feet of the retreating figure, when
      the latter, having attained the extremity of the velvet apartment, turned
      suddenly and confronted his pursuer. There was a sharp cry—and the
      dagger dropped gleaming upon the sable carpet, upon which, instantly
      afterwards, fell prostrate in death the Prince Prospero. Then, summoning
      the wild courage of despair, a throng of the revellers at once threw
      themselves into the black apartment, and, seizing the mummer, whose tall
      figure stood erect and motionless within the shadow of the ebony clock,
      gasped in unutterable horror at finding the grave-cerements and
      corpse-like mask which they handled with so violent a rudeness, untenanted
      by any tangible form.
    &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
      And now was acknowledged the presence of the Red Death. He had come like a
      thief in the night. And one by one dropped the revellers in the
      blood-bedewed halls of their revel, and died each in the despairing
      posture of his fall. And the life of the ebony clock went out with that of
      the last of the gay. And the flames of the tripods expired. And Darkness
      and Decay and the Red Death held illimitable dominion over all.
    &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;!--end chapter--&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;&lt;a id=&#34;chap2.11&#34;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;THE CASK OF AMONTILLADO.&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
      The thousand injuries of Fortunato I had borne as I best could; but when
      he ventured upon insult, I vowed revenge. You, who so well know the nature
      of my soul, will not suppose, however, that I gave utterance to a threat.
      &lt;i&gt;At length&lt;/i&gt; I would be avenged; this was a point definitively settled—but
      the very definitiveness with which it was resolved, precluded the idea of
      risk. I must not only punish, but punish with impunity. A wrong is
      unredressed when retribution overtakes its redresser. It is equally
      unredressed when the avenger fails to make himself felt as such to him who
      has done the wrong.
    &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
      It must be understood, that neither by word nor deed had I given Fortunato
      cause to doubt my good will. I continued, as was my wont, to smile in his
      face, and he did not perceive that my smile &lt;i&gt;now&lt;/i&gt; was at the thought
      of his immolation.
    &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
      He had a weak point—this Fortunato—although in other regards
      he was a man to be respected and even feared. He prided himself on his
      connoisseurship in wine. Few Italians have the true virtuoso spirit. For
      the most part their enthusiasm is adopted to suit the time and opportunity—to
      practise imposture upon the British and Austrian &lt;i&gt;millionaires&lt;/i&gt;. In
      painting and gemmary, Fortunato, like his countrymen, was a quack—but
      in the matter of old wines he was sincere. In this respect I did not
      differ from him materially: I was skilful in the Italian vintages myself,
      and bought largely whenever I could.
    &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
      It was about dusk, one evening during the supreme madness of the carnival
      season, that I encountered my friend. He accosted me with excessive
      warmth, for he had been drinking much. The man wore motley. He had on a
      tight-fitting parti-striped dress, and his head was surmounted by the
      conical cap and bells. I was so pleased to see him, that I thought I
      should never have done wringing his hand.
    &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
      I said to him: “My dear Fortunato, you are luckily met. How
      remarkably well you are looking to-day! But I have received a pipe of what
      passes for Amontillado, and I have my doubts.”
     &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
      “How?” said he. “Amontillado? A pipe? Impossible! And in the middle of the
      carnival!”
     &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
      “I have my doubts,” I replied; “and I was silly enough to pay the full
      Amontillado price without consulting you in the matter. You were not to be
      found, and I was fearful of losing a bargain.”
     &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
      “Amontillado!”
     &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
      “I have my doubts.”
     &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
      “Amontillado!”
     &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
      “And I must satisfy them.”
     &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
      “Amontillado!”
     &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
      “As you are engaged, I am on my way to Luchesi. If any one has a critical
      turn, it is he. He will tell me—”
     &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
      “Luchesi cannot tell Amontillado from Sherry.”
     &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
      “And yet some fools will have it that his taste is a match for your own.”
     &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
      “Come, let us go.”
     &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
      “Whither?”
     &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
      “To your vaults.”
     &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
      “My friend, no; I will not impose upon your good nature. I perceive you
      have an engagement. Luchesi—”
     &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
      “I have no engagement;—come.”
     &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
      “My friend, no. It is not the engagement, but the severe cold with which I
      perceive you are afflicted. The vaults are insufferably damp. They are
      encrusted with nitre.”
     &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
      “Let us go, nevertheless. The cold is merely nothing. Amontillado! You
      have been imposed upon. And as for Luchesi, he cannot distinguish Sherry
      from Amontillado.”
     &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
      Thus speaking, Fortunato possessed himself of my arm. Putting on a mask of
      black silk, and drawing a &lt;i&gt;roquelaire&lt;/i&gt; closely about my person, I
      suffered him to hurry me to my palazzo.
    &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
      There were no attendants at home; they had absconded to make merry in
      honor of the time. I had told them that I should not return until the
      morning, and had given them explicit orders not to stir from the house.
      These orders were sufficient, I well knew, to insure their immediate
      disappearance, one and all, as soon as my back was turned.
    &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
      I took from their sconces two flambeaux, and giving one to Fortunato,
      bowed him through several suites of rooms to the archway that led into the
      vaults. I passed down a long and winding staircase, requesting him to be
      cautious as he followed. We came at length to the foot of the descent, and
      stood together on the damp ground of the catacombs of the Montresors.
    &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
      The gait of my friend was unsteady, and the bells upon his cap jingled as
      he strode.
    &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
      “The pipe,” said he.
    &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
      “It is farther on,” said I; “but observe the white web-work which gleams
      from these cavern walls.”
     &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
      He turned towards me, and looked into my eyes with two filmy orbs that
      distilled the rheum of intoxication.
    &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
      “Nitre?” he asked, at length.
    &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
      “Nitre,” I replied. “How long have you had that cough?”
     &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
      “Ugh! ugh! ugh!—ugh! ugh! ugh!—ugh! ugh! ugh!—ugh! ugh!
      ugh!—ugh! ugh! ugh!”
     &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
      My poor friend found it impossible to reply for many minutes.
    &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
      “It is nothing,” he said, at last.
    &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
      “Come,” I said, with decision, “we will go back; your health is precious.
      You are rich, respected, admired, beloved; you are happy, as once I was.
      You are a man to be missed. For me it is no matter. We will go back; you
      will be ill, and I cannot be responsible. Besides, there is Luchesi—”
     &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
      “Enough,” he said; “the cough is a mere nothing; it will not kill me. I
      shall not die of a cough.”
     &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
      “True—true,” I replied; “and, indeed, I had no intention of alarming
      you unnecessarily—but you should use all proper caution. A draught
      of this Medoc will defend us from the damps.”
     &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
      Here I knocked off the neck of a bottle which I drew from a long row of
      its fellows that lay upon the mould.
    &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
      “Drink,” I said, presenting him the wine.
    &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
      He raised it to his lips with a leer. He paused and nodded to me
      familiarly, while his bells jingled.
    &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
      “I drink,” he said, “to the buried that repose around us.”
     &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
      “And I to your long life.”
     &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
      He again took my arm, and we proceeded.
    &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
      “These vaults,” he said, “are extensive.”
     &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
      “The Montresors,” I replied, “were a great and numerous family.”
     &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
      “I forget your arms.”
     &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
      “A huge human foot d’or, in a field azure; the foot crushes a serpent
      rampant whose fangs are imbedded in the heel.”
     &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
      “And the motto?”
     &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
      “&lt;i&gt;Nemo me impune lacessit&lt;/i&gt;.”
     &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
      “Good!” he said.
    &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
      The wine sparkled in his eyes and the bells jingled. My own fancy grew
      warm with the Medoc. We had passed through walls of piled bones, with
      casks and puncheons intermingling, into the inmost recesses of the
      catacombs. I paused again, and this time I made bold to seize Fortunato by
      an arm above the elbow.
    &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
      “The nitre!” I said: “see, it increases. It hangs like moss upon the
      vaults. We are below the river’s bed. The drops of moisture trickle among
      the bones. Come, we will go back ere it is too late. Your cough—”
     &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
      “It is nothing,” he said; “let us go on. But first, another draught of the
      Medoc.”
     &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
      I broke and reached him a flagon of De Grâve. He emptied it at a breath.
      His eyes flashed with a fierce light. He laughed and threw the bottle
      upwards with a gesticulation I did not understand.
    &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
      I looked at him in surprise. He repeated the movement—a grotesque
      one.
    &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
      “You do not comprehend?” he said.
    &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
      “Not I,” I replied.
    &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
      “Then you are not of the brotherhood.”
     &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
      “How?”
     &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
      “You are not of the masons.”
     &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
      “Yes, yes,” I said, “yes, yes.”
     &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
      “You? Impossible! A mason?”
     &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
      “A mason,” I replied.
    &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
      “A sign,” he said.
    &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
      “It is this,” I answered, producing a trowel from beneath the folds of my
      &lt;i&gt;roquelaire&lt;/i&gt;.
    &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
      “You jest,” he exclaimed, recoiling a few paces. “But let us proceed to
      the Amontillado.”
     &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
      “Be it so,” I said, replacing the tool beneath the cloak, and again
      offering him my arm. He leaned upon it heavily. We continued our route in
      search of the Amontillado. We passed through a range of low arches,
      descended, passed on, and descending again, arrived at a deep crypt, in
      which the foulness of the air caused our flambeaux rather to glow than
      flame.
    &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
      At the most remote end of the crypt there appeared another less spacious.
      Its walls had been lined with human remains, piled to the vault overhead,
      in the fashion of the great catacombs of Paris. Three sides of this
      interior crypt were still ornamented in this manner. From the fourth the
      bones had been thrown down, and lay promiscuously upon the earth, forming
      at one point a mound of some size. Within the wall thus exposed by the
      displacing of the bones, we perceived a still interior recess, in depth
      about four feet, in width three, in height six or seven. It seemed to have
      been constructed for no especial use in itself, but formed merely the
      interval between two of the colossal supports of the roof of the
      catacombs, and was backed by one of their circumscribing walls of solid
      granite.
    &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
      It was in vain that Fortunato, uplifting his dull torch, endeavored to pry
      into the depths of the recess. Its termination the feeble light did not
      enable us to see.
    &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
      “Proceed,” I said; “herein is the Amontillado. As for Luchesi—”
     &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
      “He is an ignoramus,” interrupted my friend, as he stepped unsteadily
      forward, while I followed immediately at his heels. In an instant he had
      reached the extremity of the niche, and finding his progress arrested by
      the rock, stood stupidly bewildered. A moment more and I had fettered him
      to the granite. In its surface were two iron staples, distant from each
      other about two feet, horizontally. From one of these depended a short
      chain, from the other a padlock. Throwing the links about his waist, it
      was but the work of a few seconds to secure it. He was too much astounded
      to resist. Withdrawing the key I stepped back from the recess.
    &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
      “Pass your hand,” I said, “over the wall; you cannot help feeling the
      nitre. Indeed it is &lt;i&gt;very&lt;/i&gt; damp. Once more let me &lt;i&gt;implore&lt;/i&gt; you
      to return. No? Then I must positively leave you. But I must first render
      you all the little attentions in my power.”
     &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
      “The Amontillado!” ejaculated my friend, not yet recovered from his
      astonishment.
    &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
      “True,” I replied; “the Amontillado.”
     &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
      As I said these words I busied myself among the pile of bones of which I
      have before spoken. Throwing them aside, I soon uncovered a quantity of
      building stone and mortar. With these materials and with the aid of my
      trowel, I began vigorously to wall up the entrance of the niche.
    &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
      I had scarcely laid the first tier of my masonry when I discovered that
      the intoxication of Fortunato had in a great measure worn off. The
      earliest indication I had of this was a low moaning cry from the depth of
      the recess. It was &lt;i&gt;not&lt;/i&gt; the cry of a drunken man. There was then a
      long and obstinate silence. I laid the second tier, and the third, and the
      fourth; and then I heard the furious vibrations of the chain. The noise
      lasted for several minutes, during which, that I might hearken to it with
      the more satisfaction, I ceased my labors and sat down upon the bones.
      When at last the clanking subsided, I resumed the trowel, and finished
      without interruption the fifth, the sixth, and the seventh tier. The wall
      was now nearly upon a level with my breast. I again paused, and holding
      the flambeaux over the mason-work, threw a few feeble rays upon the figure
      within.
    &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
      A succession of loud and shrill screams, bursting suddenly from the throat
      of the chained form, seemed to thrust me violently back. For a brief
      moment I hesitated—I trembled. Unsheathing my rapier, I began to
      grope with it about the recess; but the thought of an instant reassured
      me. I placed my hand upon the solid fabric of the catacombs, and felt
      satisfied. I reapproached the wall. I replied to the yells of him who
      clamored. I re-echoed—I aided—I surpassed them in volume and
      in strength. I did this, and the clamorer grew still.
    &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
      It was now midnight, and my task was drawing to a close. I had completed
      the eighth, the ninth, and the tenth tier. I had finished a portion of the
      last and the eleventh; there remained but a single stone to be fitted and
      plastered in. I struggled with its weight; I placed it partially in its
      destined position. But now there came from out the niche a low laugh that
      erected the hairs upon my head. It was succeeded by a sad voice, which I
      had difficulty in recognising as that of the noble Fortunato. The voice
      said—
    &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
      “Ha! ha! ha!—he! he!—a very good joke indeed—an
      excellent jest. We will have many a rich laugh about it at the palazzo—he!
      he! he!—over our wine—he! he! he!”
     &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
      “The Amontillado!” I said.
    &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
      “He! he! he!—he! he! he!—yes, the Amontillado. But is it not
      getting late? Will not they be awaiting us at the palazzo, the Lady
      Fortunato and the rest? Let us be gone.”
     &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
      “Yes,” I said, “let us be gone.”
     &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
      “&lt;i&gt;For the love of God, Montressor!&lt;/i&gt;”
     &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
      “Yes,” I said, “for the love of God!”
     &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
      But to these words I hearkened in vain for a reply. I grew impatient. I
      called aloud—
    &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
      “Fortunato!”
     &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
      No answer. I called again—
    &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
      “Fortunato!”
     &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
      No answer still. I thrust a torch through the remaining aperture and let
      it fall within. There came forth in return only a jingling of the bells.
      My heart grew sick—on account of the dampness of the catacombs. I
      hastened to make an end of my labor. I forced the last stone into its
      position; I plastered it up. Against the new masonry I re-erected the old
      rampart of bones. For the half of a century no mortal has disturbed them.
      &lt;i&gt;In pace requiescat!&lt;/i&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;!--end chapter--&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;&lt;a id=&#34;chap2.12&#34;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;THE IMP OF THE PERVERSE&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
      In the consideration of the faculties and impulses—of the prima
      mobilia of the human soul, the phrenologists have failed to make room for
      a propensity which, although obviously existing as a radical, primitive,
      irreducible sentiment, has been equally overlooked by all the moralists
      who have preceded them. In the pure arrogance of the reason, we have all
      overlooked it. We have suffered its existence to escape our senses, solely
      through want of belief—of faith;—whether it be faith in
      Revelation, or faith in the Kabbala. The idea of it has never occurred to
      us, simply because of its supererogation. We saw no need of the impulse—for
      the propensity. We could not perceive its necessity. We could not
      understand, that is to say, we could not have understood, had the notion
      of this primum mobile ever obtruded itself;—we could not have
      understood in what manner it might be made to further the objects of
      humanity, either temporal or eternal. It cannot be denied that phrenology
      and, in great measure, all metaphysicianism have been concocted a priori.
      The intellectual or logical man, rather than the understanding or
      observant man, set himself to imagine designs—to dictate purposes to
      God. Having thus fathomed, to his satisfaction, the intentions of Jehovah,
      out of these intentions he built his innumerable systems of mind. In the
      matter of phrenology, for example, we first determined, naturally enough,
      that it was the design of the Deity that man should eat. We then assigned
      to man an organ of alimentiveness, and this organ is the scourge with
      which the Deity compels man, will-I nill-I, into eating. Secondly, having
      settled it to be God’s will that man should continue his species, we
      discovered an organ of amativeness, forthwith. And so with combativeness,
      with ideality, with causality, with constructiveness,—so, in short,
      with every organ, whether representing a propensity, a moral sentiment, or
      a faculty of the pure intellect. And in these arrangements of the
      Principia of human action, the Spurzheimites, whether right or wrong, in
      part, or upon the whole, have but followed, in principle, the footsteps of
      their predecessors; deducing and establishing every thing from the
      preconceived destiny of man, and upon the ground of the objects of his
      Creator.
    &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
      It would have been wiser, it would have been safer, to classify (if
      classify we must) upon the basis of what man usually or occasionally did,
      and was always occasionally doing, rather than upon the basis of what we
      took it for granted the Deity intended him to do. If we cannot comprehend
      God in his visible works, how then in his inconceivable thoughts, that
      call the works into being? If we cannot understand him in his objective
      creatures, how then in his substantive moods and phases of creation?
    &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
      Induction, &lt;i&gt;a posteriori&lt;/i&gt;, would have brought phrenology to admit, as an
      innate and primitive principle of human action, a paradoxical something,
      which we may call &lt;i&gt;perverseness&lt;/i&gt;, for want of a more characteristic term. In
      the sense I intend, it is, in fact, a &lt;i&gt;mobile&lt;/i&gt; without motive, a motive not
      &lt;i&gt;motivirt&lt;/i&gt;. Through its promptings we act without comprehensible object; or,
      if this shall be understood as a contradiction in terms, we may so far
      modify the proposition as to say, that through its promptings we act, for
      the reason that we should &lt;i&gt;not&lt;/i&gt;. In theory, no reason can be more
      unreasonable, but, in fact, there is none more strong. With certain minds,
      under certain conditions, it becomes absolutely irresistible. I am not
      more certain that I breathe, than that the assurance of the wrong or error
      of any action is often the one unconquerable &lt;i&gt;force&lt;/i&gt; which impels us, and
      alone impels us to its prosecution. Nor will this overwhelming tendency to
      do wrong for the wrong’s sake, admit of analysis, or resolution into
      ulterior elements. It is a radical, a primitive impulse—elementary. It
      will be said, I am aware, that when we persist in acts because we feel we
      should not persist in them, our conduct is but a modification of that
      which ordinarily springs from the combativeness of phrenology. But a
      glance will show the fallacy of this idea. The phrenological combativeness
      has for its essence, the necessity of self-defence. It is our safeguard
      against injury. Its principle regards our well-being; and thus the desire
      to be well is excited simultaneously with its development. It follows,
      that the desire to be well must be excited simultaneously with any
      principle which shall be merely a modification of combativeness, but in
      the case of that something which I term perverseness, the desire to be
      well is not only not aroused, but a strongly antagonistical sentiment
      exists.
    &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
      An appeal to one’s own heart is, after all, the best reply to the
      sophistry just noticed. No one who trustingly consults and thoroughly
      questions his own soul, will be disposed to deny the entire radicalness of
      the propensity in question. It is not more incomprehensible than
      distinctive. There lives no man who at some period has not been tormented,
      for example, by an earnest desire to tantalize a listener by
      circumlocution. The speaker is aware that he displeases; he has every
      intention to please, he is usually curt, precise, and clear; the most
      laconic and luminous language is struggling for utterance upon his tongue;
      it is only with difficulty that he restrains himself from giving it flow;
      he dreads and deprecates the anger of him whom he addresses; yet, the
      thought strikes him, that by certain involutions and parentheses this
      anger may be engendered. That single thought is enough. The impulse
      increases to a wish, the wish to a desire, the desire to an uncontrollable
      longing, and the longing (to the deep regret and mortification of the
      speaker, and in defiance of all consequences) is indulged.
    &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
      We have a task before us which must be speedily performed. We know that it
      will be ruinous to make delay. The most important crisis of our life
      calls, trumpet-tongued, for immediate energy and action. We glow, we are
      consumed with eagerness to commence the work, with the anticipation of
      whose glorious result our whole souls are on fire. It must, it shall be
      undertaken to-day, and yet we put it off until to-morrow; and why? There
      is no answer, except that we feel perverse, using the word with no
      comprehension of the principle. To-morrow arrives, and with it a more
      impatient anxiety to do our duty, but with this very increase of anxiety
      arrives, also, a nameless, a positively fearful, because unfathomable,
      craving for delay. This craving gathers strength as the moments fly. The
      last hour for action is at hand. We tremble with the violence of the
      conflict within us,—of the definite with the indefinite—of the
      substance with the shadow. But, if the contest have proceeded thus far, it
      is the shadow which prevails,—we struggle in vain. The clock
      strikes, and is the knell of our welfare. At the same time, it is the
      chanticleer-note to the ghost that has so long overawed us. It flies—it
      disappears—we are free. The old energy returns. We will labor now.
      Alas, it is too late!
    &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
      We stand upon the brink of a precipice. We peer into the abyss—we
      grow sick and dizzy. Our first impulse is to shrink from the danger.
      Unaccountably we remain. By slow degrees our sickness and dizziness and
      horror become merged in a cloud of unnamable feeling. By gradations, still
      more imperceptible, this cloud assumes shape, as did the vapor from the
      bottle out of which arose the genius in the Arabian Nights. But out of
      this our cloud upon the precipice’s edge, there grows into palpability, a
      shape, far more terrible than any genius or any demon of a tale, and yet
      it is but a thought, although a fearful one, and one which chills the very
      marrow of our bones with the fierceness of the delight of its horror. It
      is merely the idea of what would be our sensations during the sweeping
      precipitancy of a fall from such a height. And this fall—this
      rushing annihilation—for the very reason that it involves that one
      most ghastly and loathsome of all the most ghastly and loathsome images of
      death and suffering which have ever presented themselves to our
      imagination—for this very cause do we now the most vividly desire
      it. And because our reason violently deters us from the brink, therefore
      do we the most impetuously approach it. There is no passion in nature so
      demoniacally impatient, as that of him who, shuddering upon the edge of a
      precipice, thus meditates a plunge. To indulge, for a moment, in any
      attempt at thought, is to be inevitably lost; for reflection but urges us
      to forbear, and therefore it is, I say, that we cannot. If there be no
      friendly arm to check us, or if we fail in a sudden effort to prostrate
      ourselves backward from the abyss, we plunge, and are destroyed.
    &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
      Examine these similar actions as we will, we shall find them resulting
      solely from the spirit of the Perverse. We perpetrate them because we feel
      that we should not. Beyond or behind this there is no intelligible
      principle; and we might, indeed, deem this perverseness a direct
      instigation of the Arch-Fiend, were it not occasionally known to operate
      in furtherance of good.
    &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
      I have said thus much, that in some measure I may answer your
      question—that I may explain to you why I am here—that I may
      assign to you something that shall have at least the faint aspect of a
      cause for my wearing these fetters, and for my tenanting this cell of the
      condemned. Had I not been thus prolix, you might either have
      misunderstood me altogether, or, with the rabble, have fancied me mad. As
      it is, you will easily perceive that I am one of the many uncounted
      victims of the Imp of the Perverse.
    &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
      It is impossible that any deed could have been wrought with a more
      thorough deliberation. For weeks, for months, I pondered upon the means of
      the murder. I rejected a thousand schemes, because their accomplishment
      involved a &lt;i&gt;chance&lt;/i&gt; of detection. At length, in reading some French memoirs,
      I found an account of a nearly fatal illness that occurred to Madame
      Pilau, through the agency of a candle accidentally poisoned. The idea
      struck my fancy at once. I knew my victim’s habit of reading in bed. I
      knew, too, that his apartment was narrow and ill-ventilated. But I need
      not vex you with impertinent details. I need not describe the easy
      artifices by which I substituted, in his bed-room candle-stand, a
      wax-light of my own making for the one which I there found. The next
      morning he was discovered dead in his bed, and the coroner’s verdict was—“Death
      by the visitation of God.”
     &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
      Having inherited his estate, all went well with me for years. The idea of
      detection never once entered my brain. Of the remains of the fatal taper I
      had myself carefully disposed. I had left no shadow of a clew by which it
      would be possible to convict, or even to suspect me of the crime. It is
      inconceivable how rich a sentiment of satisfaction arose in my bosom as I
      reflected upon my absolute security. For a very long period of time I was
      accustomed to revel in this sentiment. It afforded me more real delight
      than all the mere worldly advantages accruing from my sin. But there
      arrived at length an epoch, from which the pleasurable feeling grew, by
      scarcely perceptible gradations, into a haunting and harassing thought. It
      harassed because it haunted. I could scarcely get rid of it for an
      instant. It is quite a common thing to be thus annoyed with the ringing in
      our ears, or rather in our memories, of the burthen of some ordinary song,
      or some unimpressive snatches from an opera. Nor will we be the less
      tormented if the song in itself be good, or the opera air meritorious. In
      this manner, at last, I would perpetually catch myself pondering upon my
      security, and repeating, in a low undertone, the phrase, “I am safe.”
     &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
      One day, whilst sauntering along the streets, I arrested myself in the act
      of murmuring, half aloud, these customary syllables. In a fit of
      petulance, I remodelled them thus: “I am safe—I am safe—yes—if
      I be not fool enough to make open confession!”
     &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
      No sooner had I spoken these words, than I felt an icy chill creep to my
      heart. I had had some experience in these fits of perversity (whose
      nature I have been at some trouble to explain), and I remembered well that
      in no instance I had successfully resisted their attacks. And now my own
      casual self-suggestion that I might possibly be fool enough to confess the
      murder of which I had been guilty, confronted me, as if the very ghost of
      him whom I had murdered—and beckoned me on to death.
    &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
      At first, I made an effort to shake off this nightmare of the soul. I
      walked vigorously—faster—still faster—at length I ran. I
      felt a maddening desire to shriek aloud. Every succeeding wave of thought
      overwhelmed me with new terror, for, alas! I well, too well understood
      that to think, in my situation, was to be lost. I still quickened my pace.
      I bounded like a madman through the crowded thoroughfares. At length, the
      populace took the alarm, and pursued me. I felt then the consummation of
      my fate. Could I have torn out my tongue, I would have done it, but a
      rough voice resounded in my ears—a rougher grasp seized me by the
      shoulder. I turned—I gasped for breath. For a moment I experienced
      all the pangs of suffocation; I became blind, and deaf, and giddy; and
      then some invisible fiend, I thought, struck me with his broad palm upon
      the back. The long imprisoned secret burst forth from my soul.
    &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
      They say that I spoke with a distinct enunciation, but with marked
      emphasis and passionate hurry, as if in dread of interruption before
      concluding the brief but pregnant sentences that consigned me to the
      hangman and to hell.
    &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
      Having related all that was necessary for the fullest judicial conviction,
      I fell prostrate in a swoon.
    &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
      But why shall I say more? To-day I wear these chains, and am &lt;i&gt;here!&lt;/i&gt;
      To-morrow I shall be fetterless!—&lt;i&gt;but where?&lt;/i&gt;

Nullus enim locus sine genio est.—&lt;i&gt;Servius&lt;/i&gt;.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
      “La musique,” says Marmontel, in those “Contes Moraux” (*1) which in all
      our translations, we have insisted upon calling “Moral Tales,” as if in
      mockery of their spirit—“la musique est le seul des talents qui
      jouissent de lui-même; tous les autres veulent des temoins.” He here
      confounds the pleasure derivable from sweet sounds with the capacity for
      creating them. No more than any other talent, is that for music
      susceptible of complete enjoyment, where there is no second party to
      appreciate its exercise. And it is only in common with other talents that
      it produces effects which may be fully enjoyed in solitude. The idea which
      the raconteur has either failed to entertain clearly, or has sacrificed in
      its expression to his national love of point, is, doubtless, the very
      tenable one that the higher order of music is the most thoroughly
      estimated when we are exclusively alone. The proposition, in this form,
      will be admitted at once by those who love the lyre for its own sake, and
      for its spiritual uses. But there is one pleasure still within the reach
      of fallen mortality and perhaps only one—which owes even more than
      does music to the accessory sentiment of seclusion. I mean the happiness
      experienced in the contemplation of natural scenery. In truth, the man who
      would behold aright the glory of God upon earth must in solitude behold
      that glory. To me, at least, the presence—not of human life only,
      but of life in any other form than that of the green things which grow
      upon the soil and are voiceless—is a stain upon the landscape—is
      at war with the genius of the scene. I love, indeed, to regard the dark
      valleys, and the gray rocks, and the waters that silently smile, and the
      forests that sigh in uneasy slumbers, and the proud watchful mountains
      that look down upon all,—I love to regard these as themselves but
      the colossal members of one vast animate and sentient whole—a whole
      whose form (that of the sphere) is the most perfect and most inclusive of
      all; whose path is among associate planets; whose meek handmaiden is the
      moon, whose mediate sovereign is the sun; whose life is eternity, whose
      thought is that of a God; whose enjoyment is knowledge; whose destinies
      are lost in immensity, whose cognizance of ourselves is akin with our own
      cognizance of the animalculae which infest the brain—a being which
      we, in consequence, regard as purely inanimate and material much in the
      same manner as these animalculae must thus regard us.
    &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
      Our telescopes and our mathematical investigations assure us on every hand—notwithstanding
      the cant of the more ignorant of the priesthood—that space, and
      therefore that bulk, is an important consideration in the eyes of the
      Almighty. The cycles in which the stars move are those best adapted for
      the evolution, without collision, of the greatest possible number of
      bodies. The forms of those bodies are accurately such as, within a given
      surface, to include the greatest possible amount of matter;—while
      the surfaces themselves are so disposed as to accommodate a denser
      population than could be accommodated on the same surfaces otherwise
      arranged. Nor is it any argument against bulk being an object with God,
      that space itself is infinite; for there may be an infinity of matter to
      fill it. And since we see clearly that the endowment of matter with
      vitality is a principle—indeed, as far as our judgments extend, the
      leading principle in the operations of Deity,—it is scarcely logical
      to imagine it confined to the regions of the minute, where we daily trace
      it, and not extending to those of the august. As we find cycle within
      cycle without end,—yet all revolving around one far-distant centre
      which is the God-head, may we not analogically suppose in the same manner,
      life within life, the less within the greater, and all within the Spirit
      Divine? In short, we are madly erring, through self-esteem, in believing
      man, in either his temporal or future destinies, to be of more moment in
      the universe than that vast “clod of the valley” which he tills and
      contemns, and to which he denies a soul for no more profound reason than
      that he does not behold it in operation. (*2)
    &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
      These fancies, and such as these, have always given to my meditations
      among the mountains and the forests, by the rivers and the ocean, a tinge
      of what the everyday world would not fail to term fantastic. My wanderings
      amid such scenes have been many, and far-searching, and often solitary;
      and the interest with which I have strayed through many a dim, deep
      valley, or gazed into the reflected Heaven of many a bright lake, has been
      an interest greatly deepened by the thought that I have strayed and gazed
      alone. What flippant Frenchman was it who said in allusion to the
      well-known work of Zimmerman, that, “la solitude est une belle chose; mais
      il faut quelqu’un pour vous dire que la solitude est une belle chose?” The
      epigram cannot be gainsayed; but the necessity is a thing that does not
      exist.
    &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
      It was during one of my lonely journeyings, amid a far distant region of
      mountain locked within mountain, and sad rivers and melancholy tarn
      writhing or sleeping within all—that I chanced upon a certain
      rivulet and island. I came upon them suddenly in the leafy June, and threw
      myself upon the turf, beneath the branches of an unknown odorous shrub,
      that I might doze as I contemplated the scene. I felt that thus only
      should I look upon it—such was the character of phantasm which it
      wore.
    &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
      On all sides—save to the west, where the sun was about sinking—arose
      the verdant walls of the forest. The little river which turned sharply in
      its course, and was thus immediately lost to sight, seemed to have no exit
      from its prison, but to be absorbed by the deep green foliage of the trees
      to the east—while in the opposite quarter (so it appeared to me as I
      lay at length and glanced upward) there poured down noiselessly and
      continuously into the valley, a rich golden and crimson waterfall from the
      sunset fountains of the sky.
    &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
      About midway in the short vista which my dreamy vision took in, one small
      circular island, profusely verdured, reposed upon the bosom of the stream.
    &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&#34;poem&#34;&gt;
      So blended bank and shadow there&lt;br/&gt;
      That each seemed pendulous in air—
    &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&#34;noindent&#34;&gt;
      so mirror-like was the glassy water, that it was scarcely possible to say
      at what point upon the slope of the emerald turf its crystal dominion
      began.
    &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
      My position enabled me to include in a single view both the eastern and
      western extremities of the islet; and I observed a singularly-marked
      difference in their aspects. The latter was all one radiant harem of
      garden beauties. It glowed and blushed beneath the eyes of the slant
      sunlight, and fairly laughed with flowers. The grass was short, springy,
      sweet-scented, and asphodel-interspersed. The trees were lithe, mirthful,
      erect—bright, slender, and graceful,—of Eastern figure and
      foliage, with bark smooth, glossy, and parti-colored. There seemed a deep
      sense of life and joy about all; and although no airs blew from out the
      heavens, yet every thing had motion through the gentle sweepings to and
      fro of innumerable butterflies, that might have been mistaken for tulips
      with wings. (*4)
    &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
      The other or eastern end of the isle was whelmed in the blackest shade. A
      sombre, yet beautiful and peaceful gloom here pervaded all things. The
      trees were dark in color, and mournful in form and attitude, wreathing
      themselves into sad, solemn, and spectral shapes that conveyed ideas of
      mortal sorrow and untimely death. The grass wore the deep tint of the
      cypress, and the heads of its blades hung droopingly, and hither and
      thither among it were many small unsightly hillocks, low and narrow, and
      not very long, that had the aspect of graves, but were not; although over
      and all about them the rue and the rosemary clambered. The shade of the
      trees fell heavily upon the water, and seemed to bury itself therein,
      impregnating the depths of the element with darkness. I fancied that each
      shadow, as the sun descended lower and lower, separated itself sullenly
      from the trunk that gave it birth, and thus became absorbed by the stream;
      while other shadows issued momently from the trees, taking the place of
      their predecessors thus entombed.
    &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
      This idea, having once seized upon my fancy, greatly excited it, and I
      lost myself forthwith in revery. “If ever island were enchanted,” said I
      to myself, “this is it. This is the haunt of the few gentle Fays who
      remain from the wreck of the race. Are these green tombs theirs?—or
      do they yield up their sweet lives as mankind yield up their own? In
      dying, do they not rather waste away mournfully, rendering unto God,
      little by little, their existence, as these trees render up shadow after
      shadow, exhausting their substance unto dissolution? What the wasting tree
      is to the water that imbibes its shade, growing thus blacker by what it
      preys upon, may not the life of the Fay be to the death which engulfs it?”
     &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
      As I thus mused, with half-shut eyes, while the sun sank rapidly to rest,
      and eddying currents careered round and round the island, bearing upon
      their bosom large, dazzling, white flakes of the bark of the
      sycamore—flakes which, in their multiform positions upon the water, a
      quick imagination might have converted into anything it pleased—while I
      thus mused, it appeared to me that the form of one of those very Fays
      about whom I had been pondering made its way slowly into the darkness from
      out the light at the western end of the island. She stood erect in a
      singularly fragile canoe, and urged it with the mere phantom of an oar.
      While within the influence of the lingering sunbeams, her attitude seemed
      indicative of joy—but sorrow deformed it as she passed within the
      shade. Slowly she glided along, and at length rounded the islet and
      re-entered the region of light. “The revolution which has just been made
      by the Fay,” continued I, musingly, “is the cycle of the brief year of her
      life. She has floated through her winter and through her summer. She is a
      year nearer unto Death; for I did not fail to see that, as she came into
      the shade, her shadow fell from her, and was swallowed up in the dark
      water, making its blackness more black.”
     &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
      And again the boat appeared and the Fay; but about the attitude of the
      latter there was more of care and uncertainty and less of elastic joy. She
      floated again from out the light and into the gloom (which deepened
      momently) and again her shadow fell from her into the ebony water, and
      became absorbed into its blackness. And again and again she made the
      circuit of the island, (while the sun rushed down to his slumbers), and at
      each issuing into the light there was more sorrow about her person, while
      it grew feebler and far fainter and more indistinct, and at each passage
      into the gloom there fell from her a darker shade, which became whelmed in
      a shadow more black. But at length when the sun had utterly departed, the
      Fay, now the mere ghost of her former self, went disconsolately with her
      boat into the region of the ebony flood—and that she issued thence at all
      I cannot say, for darkness fell over all things and I beheld her magical
      figure no more.

      Ill-fated and mysterious man!—bewildered in the brilliancy of thine
      own imagination, and fallen in the flames of thine own youth! Again in
      fancy I behold thee! Once more thy form hath risen before
      me!—not—oh! not as thou art—in the cold valley and
      shadow—but as thou &lt;i&gt;shouldst be&lt;/i&gt;—squandering away a life
      of magnificent meditation in that city of dim visions, thine own
      Venice—which is a star-beloved Elysium of the sea, and the wide
      windows of whose Palladian palaces look down with a deep and bitter
      meaning upon the secrets of her silent waters. Yes! I repeat it—as
      thou &lt;i&gt;shouldst be&lt;/i&gt;. There are surely other worlds than
      this—other thoughts than the thoughts of the multitude—other
      speculations than the speculations of the sophist. Who then shall call
      thy conduct into question? who blame thee for thy visionary hours, or
      denounce those occupations as a wasting away of life, which were but the
      overflowings of thine everlasting energies?
    &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
      It was at Venice, beneath the covered archway there called the &lt;i&gt;Ponte di
      Sospiri&lt;/i&gt;, that I met for the third or fourth time the person of whom I
      speak. It is with a confused recollection that I bring to mind the
      circumstances of that meeting. Yet I remember—ah! how should I
      forget?—the deep midnight, the Bridge of Sighs, the beauty of woman,
      and the Genius of Romance that stalked up and down the narrow canal.
    &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
      It was a night of unusual gloom. The great clock of the Piazza had sounded
      the fifth hour of the Italian evening. The square of the Campanile lay
      silent and deserted, and the lights in the old Ducal Palace were dying
      fast away. I was returning home from the Piazetta, by way of the Grand
      Canal. But as my gondola arrived opposite the mouth of the canal San
      Marco, a female voice from its recesses broke suddenly upon the night, in
      one wild, hysterical, and long continued shriek. Startled at the sound, I
      sprang upon my feet: while the gondolier, letting slip his single oar,
      lost it in the pitchy darkness beyond a chance of recovery, and we were
      consequently left to the guidance of the current which here sets from the
      greater into the smaller channel. Like some huge and sable-feathered
      condor, we were slowly drifting down towards the Bridge of Sighs, when a
      thousand flambeaux flashing from the windows, and down the staircases of
      the Ducal Palace, turned all at once that deep gloom into a livid and
      preternatural day.
    &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
      A child, slipping from the arms of its own mother, had fallen from an
      upper window of the lofty structure into the deep and dim canal. The quiet
      waters had closed placidly over their victim; and, although my own gondola
      was the only one in sight, many a stout swimmer, already in the stream,
      was seeking in vain upon the surface, the treasure which was to be found,
      alas! only within the abyss. Upon the broad black marble flagstones at the
      entrance of the palace, and a few steps above the water, stood a figure
      which none who then saw can have ever since forgotten. It was the Marchesa
      Aphrodite—the adoration of all Venice—the gayest of the gay—the
      most lovely where all were beautiful—but still the young wife of the
      old and intriguing Mentoni, and the mother of that fair child, her first
      and only one, who now, deep beneath the murky water, was thinking in
      bitterness of heart upon her sweet caresses, and exhausting its little
      life in struggles to call upon her name.
    &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
      She stood alone. Her small, bare, and silvery feet gleamed in the black
      mirror of marble beneath her. Her hair, not as yet more than half loosened
      for the night from its ball-room array, clustered, amid a shower of
      diamonds, round and round her classical head, in curls like those of the
      young hyacinth. A snowy-white and gauze-like drapery seemed to be nearly
      the sole covering to her delicate form; but the mid-summer and midnight
      air was hot, sullen, and still, and no motion in the statue-like form
      itself, stirred even the folds of that raiment of very vapor which hung
      around it as the heavy marble hangs around the Niobe. Yet—strange to
      say!—her large lustrous eyes were not turned downwards upon that
      grave wherein her brightest hope lay buried—but riveted in a widely
      different direction! The prison of the Old Republic is, I think, the
      stateliest building in all Venice—but how could that lady gaze so
      fixedly upon it, when beneath her lay stifling her only child? Yon dark,
      gloomy niche, too, yawns right opposite her chamber window—what,
      then, &lt;i&gt;could&lt;/i&gt; there be in its shadows—in its architecture—in
      its ivy-wreathed and solemn cornices—that the Marchesa di Mentoni
      had not wondered at a thousand times before? Nonsense!—Who does not
      remember that, at such a time as this, the eye, like a shattered mirror,
      multiplies the images of its sorrow, and sees in innumerable far-off
      places, the woe which is close at hand?
    &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
      Many steps above the Marchesa, and within the arch of the water-gate,
      stood, in full dress, the Satyr-like figure of Mentoni himself. He was
      occasionally occupied in thrumming a guitar, and seemed &lt;i&gt;ennuye&lt;/i&gt; to
      the very death, as at intervals he gave directions for the recovery of his
      child. Stupefied and aghast, I had myself no power to move from the
      upright position I had assumed upon first hearing the shriek, and must
      have presented to the eyes of the agitated group a spectral and ominous
      appearance, as with pale countenance and rigid limbs, I floated down among
      them in that funereal gondola.
    &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
      All efforts proved in vain. Many of the most energetic in the search were
      relaxing their exertions, and yielding to a gloomy sorrow. There seemed
      but little hope for the child; (how much less than for the mother!) but
      now, from the interior of that dark niche which has been already mentioned
      as forming a part of the Old Republican prison, and as fronting the
      lattice of the Marchesa, a figure muffled in a cloak, stepped out within
      reach of the light, and, pausing a moment upon the verge of the giddy
      descent, plunged headlong into the canal. As, in an instant afterwards, he
      stood with the still living and breathing child within his grasp, upon the
      marble flagstones by the side of the Marchesa, his cloak, heavy with the
      drenching water, became unfastened, and, falling in folds about his feet,
      discovered to the wonder-stricken spectators the graceful person of a very
      young man, with the sound of whose name the greater part of Europe was
      then ringing.
    &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
      No word spoke the deliverer. But the Marchesa! She will now receive her
      child—she will press it to her heart—she will cling to its
      little form, and smother it with her caresses. Alas! &lt;i&gt;another’s&lt;/i&gt; arms
      have taken it from the stranger—&lt;i&gt;another’s&lt;/i&gt; arms have taken it
      away, and borne it afar off, unnoticed, into the palace! And the Marchesa!
      Her lip—her beautiful lip trembles; tears are gathering in her eyes—those
      eyes which, like Pliny’s acanthus, are “soft and almost liquid.” Yes!
      tears are gathering in those eyes—and see! the entire woman thrills
      throughout the soul, and the statue has started into life! The pallor of
      the marble countenance, the swelling of the marble bosom, the very purity
      of the marble feet, we behold suddenly flushed over with a tide of
      ungovernable crimson; and a slight shudder quivers about her delicate
      frame, as a gentle air at Napoli about the rich silver lilies in the
      grass.
    &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
      Why &lt;i&gt;should&lt;/i&gt; that lady blush! To this demand there is no answer—except
      that, having left, in the eager haste and terror of a mother’s heart, the
      privacy of her own &lt;i&gt;boudoir&lt;/i&gt;, she has neglected to enthral her tiny
      feet in their slippers, and utterly forgotten to throw over her Venetian
      shoulders that drapery which is their due. What other possible reason
      could there have been for her so blushing?—for the glance of those
      wild appealing eyes?—for the unusual tumult of that throbbing bosom?—for
      the convulsive pressure of that trembling hand?—that hand which
      fell, as Mentoni turned into the palace, accidentally, upon the hand of
      the stranger. What reason could there have been for the low—the
      singularly low tone of those unmeaning words which the lady uttered
      hurriedly in bidding him adieu? “Thou hast conquered,” she said, or the
      murmurs of the water deceived me; “thou hast conquered—one hour
      after sunrise—we shall meet—so let it be!”
     &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;hr/&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
      The tumult had subsided, the lights had died away within the palace, and
      the stranger, whom I now recognized, stood alone upon the flags. He shook
      with inconceivable agitation, and his eye glanced around in search of a
      gondola. I could not do less than offer him the service of my own; and he
      accepted the civility. Having obtained an oar at the water-gate, we
      proceeded together to his residence, while he rapidly recovered his
      self-possession, and spoke of our former slight acquaintance in terms of
      great apparent cordiality.
    &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
      There are some subjects upon which I take pleasure in being minute. The
      person of the stranger—let me call him by this title, who to all the
      world was still a stranger—the person of the stranger is one of
      these subjects. In height he might have been below rather than above the
      medium size: although there were moments of intense passion when his frame
      actually &lt;i&gt;expanded&lt;/i&gt; and belied the assertion. The light, almost
      slender symmetry of his figure, promised more of that ready activity which
      he evinced at the Bridge of Sighs, than of that Herculean strength which
      he has been known to wield without an effort, upon occasions of more
      dangerous emergency. With the mouth and chin of a deity—singular,
      wild, full, liquid eyes, whose shadows varied from pure hazel to intense
      and brilliant jet—and a profusion of curling, black hair, from which
      a forehead of unusual breadth gleamed forth at intervals all light and
      ivory—his were features than which I have seen none more classically
      regular, except, perhaps, the marble ones of the Emperor Commodus. Yet his
      countenance was, nevertheless, one of those which all men have seen at
      some period of their lives, and have never afterwards seen again. It had
      no peculiar, it had no settled predominant expression to be fastened
      upon the memory; a countenance seen and instantly forgotten, but
      forgotten with a vague and never-ceasing desire of recalling it to mind.
      Not that the spirit of each rapid passion failed, at any time, to throw
      its own distinct image upon the mirror of that face—but that the
      mirror, mirror-like, retained no vestige of the passion, when the passion
      had departed.
    &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
      Upon leaving him on the night of our adventure, he solicited me, in what I
      thought an urgent manner, to call upon him &lt;i&gt;very&lt;/i&gt; early the next
      morning. Shortly after sunrise, I found myself accordingly at his Palazzo,
      one of those huge structures of gloomy, yet fantastic pomp, which tower
      above the waters of the Grand Canal in the vicinity of the Rialto. I was
      shown up a broad winding staircase of mosaics, into an apartment whose
      unparalleled splendor burst through the opening door with an actual glare,
      making me blind and dizzy with luxuriousness.
    &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
      I knew my acquaintance to be wealthy. Report had spoken of his possessions
      in terms which I had even ventured to call terms of ridiculous
      exaggeration. But as I gazed about me, I could not bring myself to believe
      that the wealth of any subject in Europe could have supplied the princely
      magnificence which burned and blazed around.
    &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
      Although, as I say, the sun had arisen, yet the room was still brilliantly
      lighted up. I judge from this circumstance, as well as from an air of
      exhaustion in the countenance of my friend, that he had not retired to bed
      during the whole of the preceding night. In the architecture and
      embellishments of the chamber, the evident design had been to dazzle and
      astound. Little attention had been paid to the &lt;i&gt;decora&lt;/i&gt; of what is
      technically called &lt;i&gt;keeping&lt;/i&gt;, or to the proprieties of nationality.
      The eye wandered from object to object, and rested upon none—neither
      the &lt;i&gt;grotesques&lt;/i&gt; of the Greek painters, nor the sculptures of the
      best Italian days, nor the huge carvings of untutored Egypt. Rich
      draperies in every part of the room trembled to the vibration of low,
      melancholy music, whose origin was not to be discovered. The senses were
      oppressed by mingled and conflicting perfumes, reeking up from strange
      convolute censers, together with multitudinous flaring and flickering
      tongues of emerald and violet fire. The rays of the newly risen sun poured
      in upon the whole, through windows, formed each of a single pane of
      crimson-tinted glass. Glancing to and fro, in a thousand reflections, from
      curtains which rolled from their cornices like cataracts of molten silver,
      the beams of natural glory mingled at length fitfully with the artificial
      light, and lay weltering in subdued masses upon a carpet of rich,
      liquid-looking cloth of Chili gold.
    &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
      “Ha! ha! ha!—ha! ha! ha!”—laughed the proprietor,
      motioning me to a seat as I entered the room, and throwing himself back
      at full-length upon an ottoman. “I see,” said he, perceiving
      that I could not immediately reconcile myself to the &lt;i&gt;bienseance&lt;/i&gt; of
      so singular a welcome—“I see you are astonished at my
      apartment—at my statues—my pictures—my originality of
      conception in architecture and upholstery! absolutely drunk, eh, with my
      magnificence? But pardon me, my dear sir, (here his tone of voice dropped
      to the very spirit of cordiality,) pardon me for my uncharitable
      laughter. You appeared so &lt;i&gt;utterly&lt;/i&gt; astonished. Besides, some things
      are so completely ludicrous, that a man &lt;i&gt;must&lt;/i&gt; laugh or die. To die
      laughing, must be the most glorious of all glorious deaths! Sir Thomas
      More—a very fine man was Sir Thomas More—Sir Thomas More died
      laughing, you remember. Also in the &lt;i&gt;Absurdities&lt;/i&gt; of Ravisius
      Textor, there is a long list of characters who came to the same
      magnificent end. Do you know, however,” continued he musingly,
      “that at Sparta (which is now Palæochori,) at Sparta, I say, to the
      west of the citadel, among a chaos of scarcely visible ruins, is a kind
      of &lt;i&gt;socle&lt;/i&gt;, upon which are still legible the letters
      ΛΑΞΜ. They are undoubtedly part of
      ΓΕΛΑΞΜΑ. Now, at Sparta were a
      thousand temples and shrines to a thousand different divinities. How
      exceedingly strange that the altar of Laughter should have survived all
      the others! But in the present instance,” he resumed, with a
      singular alteration of voice and manner, “I have no right to be
      merry at your expense. You might well have been amazed. Europe cannot
      produce anything so fine as this, my little regal cabinet. My other
      apartments are by no means of the same order—mere &lt;i&gt;ultras&lt;/i&gt; of
      fashionable insipidity. This is better than fashion—is it not? Yet
      this has but to be seen to become the rage—that is, with those who
      could afford it at the cost of their entire patrimony. I have guarded,
      however, against any such profanation. With one exception, you are the
      only human being besides myself and my &lt;i&gt;valet&lt;/i&gt;, who has been
      admitted within the mysteries of these imperial precincts, since they
      have been bedizened as you see!”
     &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
      I bowed in acknowledgment—for the overpowering sense of splendor and
      perfume, and music, together with the unexpected eccentricity of his
      address and manner, prevented me from expressing, in words, my
      appreciation of what I might have construed into a compliment.
    &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
      “Here,” he resumed, arising and leaning on my arm as he sauntered around
      the apartment, “here are paintings from the Greeks to Cimabue, and from
      Cimabue to the present hour. Many are chosen, as you see, with little
      deference to the opinions of Virtu. They are all, however, fitting
      tapestry for a chamber such as this. Here, too, are some &lt;i&gt;chefs d’oeuvre&lt;/i&gt;
      of the unknown great; and here, unfinished designs by men, celebrated in
      their day, whose very names the perspicacity of the academies has left to
      silence and to me. What think you,” said he, turning abruptly as he spoke—“what
      think you of this Madonna della Pieta?”
     &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
      “It is Guido’s own!” I said, with all the enthusiasm of my nature, for I
      had been poring intently over its surpassing loveliness. “It is Guido’s
      own!—how &lt;i&gt;could&lt;/i&gt; you have obtained it?—she is undoubtedly
      in painting what the Venus is in sculpture.”
     &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
      “Ha!” said he thoughtfully, “the Venus—the beautiful Venus?—the
      Venus of the Medici?—she of the diminutive head and the gilded hair?
      Part of the left arm (here his voice dropped so as to be heard with
      difficulty,) and all the right, are restorations; and in the coquetry of
      that right arm lies, I think, the quintessence of all affectation. Give &lt;i&gt;me&lt;/i&gt;
      the Canova! The Apollo, too, is a copy—there can be no doubt of it—blind
      fool that I am, who cannot behold the boasted inspiration of the Apollo! I
      cannot help—pity me!—I cannot help preferring the Antinous.
      Was it not Socrates who said that the statuary found his statue in the
      block of marble? Then Michael Angelo was by no means original in his
      couplet—
    &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&#34;poem&#34;&gt;
     ‘Non ha l’ottimo artista alcun concetto&lt;br/&gt;
     Che un marmo solo in se non circunscriva.’”
 &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
      It has been, or should be remarked, that, in the manner of the true
      gentleman, we are always aware of a difference from the bearing of the
      vulgar, without being at once precisely able to determine in what such
      difference consists. Allowing the remark to have applied in its full force
      to the outward demeanor of my acquaintance, I felt it, on that eventful
      morning, still more fully applicable to his moral temperament and
      character. Nor can I better define that peculiarity of spirit which seemed
      to place him so essentially apart from all other human beings, than by
      calling it a &lt;i&gt;habit&lt;/i&gt; of intense and continual thought, pervading even
      his most trivial actions—intruding upon his moments of dalliance—and
      interweaving itself with his very flashes of merriment—like adders
      which writhe from out the eyes of the grinning masks in the cornices
      around the temples of Persepolis.
    &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
      I could not help, however, repeatedly observing, through the mingled tone
      of levity and solemnity with which he rapidly descanted upon matters of
      little importance, a certain air of trepidation—a degree of nervous
      &lt;i&gt;unction&lt;/i&gt; in action and in speech—an unquiet excitability of
      manner which appeared to me at all times unaccountable, and upon some
      occasions even filled me with alarm. Frequently, too, pausing in the
      middle of a sentence whose commencement he had apparently forgotten, he
      seemed to be listening in the deepest attention, as if either in momentary
      expectation of a visitor, or to sounds which must have had existence in
      his imagination alone.
    &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
      It was during one of these reveries or pauses of apparent abstraction,
      that, in turning over a page of the poet and scholar Politian’s beautiful
      tragedy “The Orfeo,” (the first native Italian tragedy,) which lay near me
      upon an ottoman, I discovered a passage underlined in pencil. It was a
      passage towards the end of the third act—a passage of the most
      heart-stirring excitement—a passage which, although tainted with
      impurity, no man shall read without a thrill of novel emotion—no
      woman without a sigh. The whole page was blotted with fresh tears; and,
      upon the opposite interleaf, were the following English lines, written in
      a hand so very different from the peculiar characters of my acquaintance,
      that I had some difficulty in recognising it as his own:—
    &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&#34;poem&#34;&gt;
Thou wast that all to me, love,&lt;br/&gt;
    For which my soul did pine—&lt;br/&gt;
A green isle in the sea, love,&lt;br/&gt;
    A fountain and a shrine,&lt;br/&gt;
All wreathed with fairy fruits and flowers;&lt;br/&gt;
    And all the flowers were mine.&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
Ah, dream too bright to last!&lt;br/&gt;
    Ah, starry Hope, that didst arise&lt;br/&gt;
But to be overcast!&lt;br/&gt;
    A voice from out the Future cries,&lt;br/&gt;
“Onward!”—but o’er the Past&lt;br/&gt;
    (Dim gulf!) my spirit hovering lies,&lt;br/&gt;
Mute—motionless—aghast!&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
For alas!  alas!  with me&lt;br/&gt;
    The light of life is o’er.&lt;br/&gt;
“No more—no more—no more,”&lt;br/&gt;
    (Such language holds the solemn sea&lt;br/&gt;
To the sands upon the shore,)&lt;br/&gt;
    Shall bloom the thunder-blasted tree,&lt;br/&gt;
Or the stricken eagle soar!&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
Now all my hours are trances;&lt;br/&gt;
    And all my nightly dreams&lt;br/&gt;
Are where the dark eye glances,&lt;br/&gt;
    And where thy footstep gleams,&lt;br/&gt;
In what ethereal dances,&lt;br/&gt;
    By what Italian streams.&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
Alas!  for that accursed time&lt;br/&gt;
    They bore thee o’er the billow,&lt;br/&gt;
From Love to titled age and crime,&lt;br/&gt;
    And an unholy pillow!—&lt;br/&gt;
From me, and from our misty clime,&lt;br/&gt;
    Where weeps the silver willow!
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
      That these lines were written in English—a language with which I had
      not believed their author acquainted—afforded me little matter for
      surprise. I was too well aware of the extent of his acquirements, and of
      the singular pleasure he took in concealing them from observation, to be
      astonished at any similar discovery; but the place of date, I must
      confess, occasioned me no little amazement. It had been originally written
      &lt;i&gt;London&lt;/i&gt;, and afterwards carefully overscored—not, however, so
      effectually as to conceal the word from a scrutinizing eye. I say, this
      occasioned me no little amazement; for I well remember that, in a former
      conversation with a friend, I particularly inquired if he had at any time
      met in London the Marchesa di Mentoni, (who for some years previous to her
      marriage had resided in that city,) when his answer, if I mistake not,
      gave me to understand that he had never visited the metropolis of Great
      Britain. I might as well here mention, that I have more than once heard,
      (without, of course, giving credit to a report involving so many
      improbabilities,) that the person of whom I speak, was not only by birth,
      but in education, an &lt;i&gt;Englishman&lt;/i&gt;.
    &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;hr/&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
“There is one painting,” said he, without being aware of my notice
of the tragedy—“there is still one painting which you have not
seen.” And throwing aside a drapery, he discovered a full-length portrait
of the Marchesa Aphrodite.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
Human art could have done no more in the delineation of her superhuman beauty.
The same ethereal figure which stood before me the preceding night upon the
steps of the Ducal Palace, stood before me once again. But in the expression of
the countenance, which was beaming all over with smiles, there still lurked
(incomprehensible anomaly!) that fitful stain of melancholy which will ever be
found inseparable from the perfection of the beautiful. Her right arm lay
folded over her bosom. With her left she pointed downward to a curiously
fashioned vase. One small, fairy foot, alone visible, barely touched the earth;
and, scarcely discernible in the brilliant atmosphere which seemed to encircle
and enshrine her loveliness, floated a pair of the most delicately imagined
wings. My glance fell from the painting to the figure of my friend, and the
vigorous words of Chapman’s &lt;i&gt;Bussy D’Ambois&lt;/i&gt;, quivered
instinctively upon my lips:
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&#34;poem&#34;&gt;
    “He is up&lt;br/&gt;
There like a Roman statue!  He will stand&lt;br/&gt;
Till Death hath made him marble!”
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
      “Come,” he said at length, turning towards a table of richly enamelled and
      massive silver, upon which were a few goblets fantastically stained,
      together with two large Etruscan vases, fashioned in the same
      extraordinary model as that in the foreground of the portrait, and filled
      with what I supposed to be Johannisberger. “Come,” he said, abruptly, “let
      us drink! It is early—but let us drink. It is &lt;i&gt;indeed&lt;/i&gt; early,”
       he continued, musingly, as a cherub with a heavy golden hammer made the
      apartment ring with the first hour after sunrise: “It is &lt;i&gt;indeed&lt;/i&gt;
      early—but what matters it? let us drink! Let us pour out an offering
      to yon solemn sun which these gaudy lamps and censers are so eager to
      subdue!” And, having made me pledge him in a bumper, he swallowed in rapid
      succession several goblets of the wine.
    &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
      “To dream,” he continued, resuming the tone of his desultory conversation,
      as he held up to the rich light of a censer one of the magnificent vases—“to
      dream has been the business of my life. I have therefore framed for
      myself, as you see, a bower of dreams. In the heart of Venice could I have
      erected a better? You behold around you, it is true, a medley of
      architectural embellishments. The chastity of Ionia is offended by
      antediluvian devices, and the sphynxes of Egypt are outstretched upon
      carpets of gold. Yet the effect is incongruous to the timid alone.
      Proprieties of place, and especially of time, are the bugbears which
      terrify mankind from the contemplation of the magnificent. Once I was
      myself a decorist; but that sublimation of folly has palled upon my soul.
      All this is now the fitter for my purpose. Like these arabesque censers,
      my spirit is writhing in fire, and the delirium of this scene is
      fashioning me for the wilder visions of that land of real dreams whither I
      am now rapidly departing.” He here paused abruptly, bent his head to his
      bosom, and seemed to listen to a sound which I could not hear. At length,
      erecting his frame, he looked upwards, and ejaculated the lines of the
      Bishop of Chichester:
    &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&#34;poem&#34;&gt;
&lt;i&gt;“Stay for me there!  I will not fail&lt;/i&gt;&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;i&gt;To meet thee in that hollow vale.”&lt;/i&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&#34;noindent&#34;&gt;
      In the next instant, confessing the power of the wine, he threw himself at
      full-length upon an ottoman.
    &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
      A quick step was now heard upon the staircase, and a loud knock at the
      door rapidly succeeded. I was hastening to anticipate a second
      disturbance, when a page of Mentoni’s household burst into the room, and
      faltered out, in a voice choking with emotion, the incoherent words, “My
      mistress!—my mistress!—Poisoned!—poisoned! Oh, beautiful—oh,
      beautiful Aphrodite!”
     &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
      Bewildered, I flew to the ottoman, and endeavored to arouse the sleeper to
      a sense of the startling intelligence. But his limbs were rigid—his
      lips were livid—his lately beaming eyes were riveted in &lt;i&gt;death&lt;/i&gt;.
      I staggered back towards the table—my hand fell upon a cracked and
      blackened goblet—and a consciousness of the entire and terrible
      truth flashed suddenly over my soul.
    &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
      I was sick—sick unto death with that long agony; and when they at
      length unbound me, and I was permitted to sit, I felt that my senses were
      leaving me. The sentence—the dread sentence of death—was the
      last of distinct accentuation which reached my ears. After that, the sound
      of the inquisitorial voices seemed merged in one dreamy indeterminate hum.
      It conveyed to my soul the idea of &lt;i&gt;revolution&lt;/i&gt;—perhaps from its
      association in fancy with the burr of a mill wheel. This only for a brief
      period, for presently I heard no more. Yet, for a while, I saw—but with
      how terrible an exaggeration! I saw the lips of the black-robed judges.
      They appeared to me white—whiter than the sheet upon which I trace
      these words—and thin even to grotesqueness; thin with the intensity
      of their expression of firmness—of immoveable resolution—of
      stern contempt of human torture. I saw that the decrees of what to me was
      Fate, were still issuing from those lips. I saw them writhe with a deadly
      locution. I saw them fashion the syllables of my name; and I shuddered
      because no sound succeeded. I saw, too, for a few moments of delirious
      horror, the soft and nearly imperceptible waving of the sable draperies
      which enwrapped the walls of the apartment. And then my vision fell upon
      the seven tall candles upon the table. At first they wore the aspect of
      charity, and seemed white and slender angels who would save me; but then,
      all at once, there came a most deadly nausea over my spirit, and I felt
      every fibre in my frame thrill as if I had touched the wire of a galvanic
      battery, while the angel forms became meaningless spectres, with heads of
      flame, and I saw that from them there would be no help. And then there
      stole into my fancy, like a rich musical note, the thought of what sweet
      rest there must be in the grave. The thought came gently and stealthily,
      and it seemed long before it attained full appreciation; but just as my
      spirit came at length properly to feel and entertain it, the figures of
      the judges vanished, as if magically, from before me; the tall candles
      sank into nothingness; their flames went out utterly; the blackness of
      darkness supervened; all sensations appeared swallowed up in a mad rushing
      descent as of the soul into Hades. Then silence, and stillness, night were
      the universe.
    &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
      I had swooned; but still will not say that all of consciousness was lost.
      What of it there remained I will not attempt to define, or even to
      describe; yet all was not lost. In the deepest slumber—no! In
      delirium—no! In a swoon—no! In death—no! even in the
      grave all is not lost. Else there is no immortality for man. Arousing from
      the most profound of slumbers, we break the gossamer web of some dream.
      Yet in a second afterward, (so frail may that web have been) we remember
      not that we have dreamed. In the return to life from the swoon there are
      two stages; first, that of the sense of mental or spiritual; secondly,
      that of the sense of physical, existence. It seems probable that if, upon
      reaching the second stage, we could recall the impressions of the first,
      we should find these impressions eloquent in memories of the gulf beyond.
      And that gulf is—what? How at least shall we distinguish its shadows
      from those of the tomb? But if the impressions of what I have termed the
      first stage are not, at will, recalled, yet, after long interval, do they
      not come unbidden, while we marvel whence they come? He who has never
      swooned, is not he who finds strange palaces and wildly familiar faces in
      coals that glow; is not he who beholds floating in mid-air the sad visions
      that the many may not view; is not he who ponders over the perfume of some
      novel flower; is not he whose brain grows bewildered with the meaning
      of some musical cadence which has never before arrested his attention.
    &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
      Amid frequent and thoughtful endeavors to remember; amid earnest struggles
      to regather some token of the state of seeming nothingness into which my
      soul had lapsed, there have been moments when I have dreamed of success;
      there have been brief, very brief periods when I have conjured up
      remembrances which the lucid reason of a later epoch assures me could have
      had reference only to that condition of seeming unconsciousness. These
      shadows of memory tell, indistinctly, of tall figures that lifted and bore
      me in silence down—down—still down—till a hideous
      dizziness oppressed me at the mere idea of the interminableness of the
      descent. They tell also of a vague horror at my heart, on account of that
      heart’s unnatural stillness. Then comes a sense of sudden motionlessness
      throughout all things; as if those who bore me (a ghastly train!) had
      outrun, in their descent, the limits of the limitless, and paused from the
      wearisomeness of their toil. After this I call to mind flatness and
      dampness; and then all is madness—the madness of a memory which
      busies itself among forbidden things.
    &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
      Very suddenly there came back to my soul motion and sound—the
      tumultuous motion of the heart, and, in my ears, the sound of its beating.
      Then a pause in which all is blank. Then again sound, and motion, and
      touch—a tingling sensation pervading my frame. Then the mere
      consciousness of existence, without thought—a condition which lasted
      long. Then, very suddenly, thought, and shuddering terror, and earnest
      endeavor to comprehend my true state. Then a strong desire to lapse into
      insensibility. Then a rushing revival of soul and a successful effort to
      move. And now a full memory of the trial, of the judges, of the sable
      draperies, of the sentence, of the sickness, of the swoon. Then entire
      forgetfulness of all that followed; of all that a later day and much
      earnestness of endeavor have enabled me vaguely to recall.
    &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
      So far, I had not opened my eyes. I felt that I lay upon my back, unbound.
      I reached out my hand, and it fell heavily upon something damp and hard.
      There I suffered it to remain for many minutes, while I strove to imagine
      where and what I could be. I longed, yet dared not to employ my vision. I
      dreaded the first glance at objects around me. It was not that I feared to
      look upon things horrible, but that I grew aghast lest there should be
      nothing to see. At length, with a wild desperation at heart, I quickly
      unclosed my eyes. My worst thoughts, then, were confirmed. The blackness
      of eternal night encompassed me. I struggled for breath. The intensity of
      the darkness seemed to oppress and stifle me. The atmosphere was
      intolerably close. I still lay quietly, and made effort to exercise my
      reason. I brought to mind the inquisitorial proceedings, and attempted
      from that point to deduce my real condition. The sentence had passed; and
      it appeared to me that a very long interval of time had since elapsed. Yet
      not for a moment did I suppose myself actually dead. Such a supposition,
      notwithstanding what we read in fiction, is altogether inconsistent with
      real existence;—but where and in what state was I? The condemned to
      death, I knew, perished usually at the autos-da-fe, and one of these had
      been held on the very night of the day of my trial. Had I been remanded to
      my dungeon, to await the next sacrifice, which would not take place for
      many months? This I at once saw could not be. Victims had been in
      immediate demand. Moreover, my dungeon, as well as all the condemned cells
      at Toledo, had stone floors, and light was not altogether excluded.
    &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
      A fearful idea now suddenly drove the blood in torrents upon my heart, and
      for a brief period, I once more relapsed into insensibility. Upon
      recovering, I at once started to my feet, trembling convulsively in every
      fibre. I thrust my arms wildly above and around me in all directions. I
      felt nothing; yet dreaded to move a step, lest I should be impeded by the
      walls of a tomb. Perspiration burst from every pore, and stood in cold big
      beads upon my forehead. The agony of suspense grew at length intolerable,
      and I cautiously moved forward, with my arms extended, and my eyes
      straining from their sockets, in the hope of catching some faint ray of
      light. I proceeded for many paces; but still all was blackness and
      vacancy. I breathed more freely. It seemed evident that mine was not, at
      least, the most hideous of fates.
    &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
      And now, as I still continued to step cautiously onward, there came
      thronging upon my recollection a thousand vague rumors of the horrors of
      Toledo. Of the dungeons there had been strange things narrated—fables
      I had always deemed them—but yet strange, and too ghastly to repeat,
      save in a whisper. Was I left to perish of starvation in this subterranean
      world of darkness; or what fate, perhaps even more fearful, awaited me?
      That the result would be death, and a death of more than customary
      bitterness, I knew too well the character of my judges to doubt. The mode
      and the hour were all that occupied or distracted me.
    &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
      My outstretched hands at length encountered some solid obstruction. It was
      a wall, seemingly of stone masonry—very smooth, slimy, and cold. I
      followed it up; stepping with all the careful distrust with which certain
      antique narratives had inspired me. This process, however, afforded me no
      means of ascertaining the dimensions of my dungeon; as I might make its
      circuit, and return to the point whence I set out, without being aware of
      the fact; so perfectly uniform seemed the wall. I therefore sought the
      knife which had been in my pocket, when led into the inquisitorial
      chamber; but it was gone; my clothes had been exchanged for a wrapper of
      coarse serge. I had thought of forcing the blade in some minute crevice of
      the masonry, so as to identify my point of departure. The difficulty,
      nevertheless, was but trivial; although, in the disorder of my fancy, it
      seemed at first insuperable. I tore a part of the hem from the robe and
      placed the fragment at full length, and at right angles to the wall. In
      groping my way around the prison, I could not fail to encounter this rag
      upon completing the circuit. So, at least I thought: but I had not counted
      upon the extent of the dungeon, or upon my own weakness. The ground was
      moist and slippery. I staggered onward for some time, when I stumbled and
      fell. My excessive fatigue induced me to remain prostrate; and sleep soon
      overtook me as I lay.
    &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
      Upon awaking, and stretching forth an arm, I found beside me a loaf and a
      pitcher with water. I was too much exhausted to reflect upon this
      circumstance, but ate and drank with avidity. Shortly afterward, I resumed
      my tour around the prison, and with much toil came at last upon the
      fragment of the serge. Up to the period when I fell I had counted
      fifty-two paces, and upon resuming my walk, I had counted forty-eight
      more—when I arrived at the rag. There were in all, then, a hundred
      paces; and, admitting two paces to the yard, I presumed the dungeon to be
      fifty yards in circuit. I had met, however, with many angles in the wall,
      and thus I could form no guess at the shape of the vault, for vault I
      could not help supposing it to be.
    &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
      I had little object—certainly no hope—in these researches; but
      a vague curiosity prompted me to continue them. Quitting the wall, I
      resolved to cross the area of the enclosure. At first I proceeded with
      extreme caution, for the floor, although seemingly of solid material, was
      treacherous with slime. At length, however, I took courage, and did not
      hesitate to step firmly; endeavoring to cross in as direct a line as
      possible. I had advanced some ten or twelve paces in this manner, when the
      remnant of the torn hem of my robe became entangled between my legs. I
      stepped on it, and fell violently on my face.
    &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
      In the confusion attending my fall, I did not immediately apprehend a
      somewhat startling circumstance, which yet, in a few seconds afterward,
      and while I still lay prostrate, arrested my attention. It was this: my
      chin rested upon the floor of the prison, but my lips and the upper
      portion of my head, although seemingly at a less elevation than the chin,
      touched nothing. At the same time my forehead seemed bathed in a clammy
      vapor, and the peculiar smell of decayed fungus arose to my nostrils. I
      put forward my arm, and shuddered to find that I had fallen at the very
      brink of a circular pit, whose extent, of course, I had no means of
      ascertaining at the moment. Groping about the masonry just below the
      margin, I succeeded in dislodging a small fragment, and let it fall into
      the abyss. For many seconds I hearkened to its reverberations as it dashed
      against the sides of the chasm in its descent; at length there was a
      sullen plunge into water, succeeded by loud echoes. At the same moment
      there came a sound resembling the quick opening, and as rapid closing of a
      door overhead, while a faint gleam of light flashed suddenly through the
      gloom, and as suddenly faded away.
    &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
      I saw clearly the doom which had been prepared for me, and congratulated
      myself upon the timely accident by which I had escaped. Another step
      before my fall, and the world had seen me no more. And the death just
      avoided, was of that very character which I had regarded as fabulous and
      frivolous in the tales respecting the Inquisition. To the victims of its
      tyranny, there was the choice of death with its direst physical agonies,
      or death with its most hideous moral horrors. I had been reserved for the
      latter. By long suffering my nerves had been unstrung, until I trembled at
      the sound of my own voice, and had become in every respect a fitting
      subject for the species of torture which awaited me.
    &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
      Shaking in every limb, I groped my way back to the wall—resolving there
      to perish rather than risk the terrors of the wells, of which my
      imagination now pictured many in various positions about the dungeon. In
      other conditions of mind I might have had courage to end my misery at once
      by a plunge into one of these abysses; but now I was the veriest of
      cowards. Neither could I forget what I had read of these pits—that
      the sudden extinction of life formed no part of their most horrible plan.
    &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
      Agitation of spirit kept me awake for many long hours, but at length I
      again slumbered. Upon arousing, I found by my side, as before, a loaf and
      a pitcher of water. A burning thirst consumed me, and I emptied the vessel
      at a draught. It must have been drugged—for scarcely had I drunk, before
      I became irresistibly drowsy. A deep sleep fell upon me—a sleep like
      that of death. How long it lasted of course, I know not; but when, once
      again, I unclosed my eyes, the objects around me were visible. By a wild
      sulphurous lustre, the origin of which I could not at first determine, I
      was enabled to see the extent and aspect of the prison.
    &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
      In its size I had been greatly mistaken. The whole circuit of its walls
      did not exceed twenty-five yards. For some minutes this fact occasioned me
      a world of vain trouble; vain indeed! for what could be of less
      importance, under the terrible circumstances which environed me, then the
      mere dimensions of my dungeon? But my soul took a wild interest in
      trifles, and I busied myself in endeavors to account for the error I had
      committed in my measurement. The truth at length flashed upon me. In my
      first attempt at exploration I had counted fifty-two paces, up to the
      period when I fell; I must then have been within a pace or two of the
      fragment of serge; in fact, I had nearly performed the circuit of the
      vault. I then slept—and, upon awaking, I must have returned upon my steps—thus
      supposing the circuit nearly double what it actually was. My confusion of
      mind prevented me from observing that I began my tour with the wall to the
      left, and ended it with the wall to the right.
    &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
      I had been deceived, too, in respect to the shape of the enclosure. In
      feeling my way I had found many angles, and thus deduced an idea of great
      irregularity; so potent is the effect of total darkness upon one arousing
      from lethargy or sleep! The angles were simply those of a few slight
      depressions, or niches, at odd intervals. The general shape of the prison
      was square. What I had taken for masonry seemed now to be iron, or some
      other metal, in huge plates, whose sutures or joints occasioned the
      depression. The entire surface of this metallic enclosure was rudely
      daubed in all the hideous and repulsive devices to which the charnel
      superstition of the monks has given rise. The figures of fiends in aspects
      of menace, with skeleton forms, and other more really fearful images,
      overspread and disfigured the walls. I observed that the outlines of these
      monstrosities were sufficiently distinct, but that the colors seemed faded
      and blurred, as if from the effects of a damp atmosphere. I now noticed
      the floor, too, which was of stone. In the centre yawned the circular pit
      from whose jaws I had escaped; but it was the only one in the dungeon.
    &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
      All this I saw indistinctly and by much effort—for my personal
      condition had been greatly changed during slumber. I now lay upon my
      back, and at full length, on a species of low framework of wood. To this
      I was securely bound by a long strap resembling a surcingle. It passed in
      many convolutions about my limbs and body, leaving at liberty only my
      head, and my left arm to such extent that I could, by dint of much
      exertion, supply myself with food from an earthen dish which lay by my
      side on the floor. I saw, to my horror, that the pitcher had been
      removed. I say to my horror—for I was consumed with intolerable
      thirst. This thirst it appeared to be the design of my persecutors to
      stimulate—for the food in the dish was meat pungently seasoned.
    &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
      Looking upward, I surveyed the ceiling of my prison. It was some thirty or
      forty feet overhead, and constructed much as the side walls. In one of its
      panels a very singular figure riveted my whole attention. It was the
      painted figure of Time as he is commonly represented, save that, in lieu
      of a scythe, he held what, at a casual glance, I supposed to be the
      pictured image of a huge pendulum such as we see on antique clocks. There
      was something, however, in the appearance of this machine which caused me
      to regard it more attentively. While I gazed directly upward at it (for
      its position was immediately over my own) I fancied that I saw it in
      motion. In an instant afterward the fancy was confirmed. Its sweep was
      brief, and of course slow. I watched it for some minutes, somewhat in
      fear, but more in wonder. Wearied at length with observing its dull
      movement, I turned my eyes upon the other objects in the cell.
    &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
      A slight noise attracted my notice, and, looking to the floor, I saw
      several enormous rats traversing it. They had issued from the well, which
      lay just within view to my right. Even then, while I gazed, they came up
      in troops, hurriedly, with ravenous eyes, allured by the scent of the
      meat. From this it required much effort and attention to scare them away.
    &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
      It might have been half an hour, perhaps even an hour, (for I could take
      but imperfect note of time) before I again cast my eyes upward. What I
      then saw confounded and amazed me. The sweep of the pendulum had increased
      in extent by nearly a yard. As a natural consequence, its velocity was
      also much greater. But what mainly disturbed me was the idea that had
      perceptibly descended. I now observed—with what horror it is
      needless to say—that its nether extremity was formed of a crescent
      of glittering steel, about a foot in length from horn to horn; the horns
      upward, and the under edge evidently as keen as that of a razor. Like a
      razor also, it seemed massy and heavy, tapering from the edge into a solid
      and broad structure above. It was appended to a weighty rod of brass, and
      the whole hissed as it swung through the air.
    &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
      I could no longer doubt the doom prepared for me by monkish ingenuity in
      torture. My cognizance of the pit had become known to the inquisitorial
      agents—&lt;i&gt;the pit&lt;/i&gt;, whose horrors had been destined for so bold a
      recusant as myself—the pit, typical of hell, and regarded by rumor
      as the Ultima Thule of all their punishments. The plunge into this pit I
      had avoided by the merest of accidents, I knew that surprise, or
      entrapment into torment, formed an important portion of all the
      grotesquerie of these dungeon deaths. Having failed to fall, it was no
      part of the demon plan to hurl me into the abyss; and thus (there being no
      alternative) a different and a milder destruction awaited me. Milder! I
      half smiled in my agony as I thought of such application of such a term.
    &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
      What boots it to tell of the long, long hours of horror more than mortal,
      during which I counted the rushing vibrations of the steel! Inch by inch—line
      by line—with a descent only appreciable at intervals that seemed
      ages—down and still down it came! Days passed—it might have
      been that many days passed—ere it swept so closely over me as to fan
      me with its acrid breath. The odor of the sharp steel forced itself into
      my nostrils. I prayed—I wearied heaven with my prayer for its more
      speedy descent. I grew frantically mad, and struggled to force myself
      upward against the sweep of the fearful scimitar. And then I fell suddenly
      calm, and lay smiling at the glittering death, as a child at some rare
      bauble.
    &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
      There was another interval of utter insensibility; it was brief; for, upon
      again lapsing into life there had been no perceptible descent in the
      pendulum. But it might have been long; for I knew there were demons who
      took note of my swoon, and who could have arrested the vibration at
      pleasure. Upon my recovery, too, I felt very—oh! inexpressibly—sick
      and weak, as if through long inanition. Even amid the agonies of that
      period, the human nature craved food. With painful effort I outstretched
      my left arm as far as my bonds permitted, and took possession of the small
      remnant which had been spared me by the rats. As I put a portion of it
      within my lips, there rushed to my mind a half formed thought of joy—of
      hope. Yet what business had &lt;i&gt;I&lt;/i&gt; with hope? It was, as I say, a half formed
      thought—man has many such, which are never completed. I felt that it
      was of joy—of hope; but felt also that it had perished in its
      formation. In vain I struggled to perfect—to regain it. Long
      suffering had nearly annihilated all my ordinary powers of mind. I was an
      imbecile—an idiot.
    &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
      The vibration of the pendulum was at right angles to my length. I saw that
      the crescent was designed to cross the region of the heart. It would fray
      the serge of my robe—it would return and repeat its operations—again—and
      again. Notwithstanding its terrifically wide sweep (some thirty feet or more)
      and the hissing vigor of its descent, sufficient to sunder these very
      walls of iron, still the fraying of my robe would be all that, for several
      minutes, it would accomplish. And at this thought I paused. I dared not go
      farther than this reflection. I dwelt upon it with a pertinacity of
      attention—as if, in so dwelling, I could arrest here the descent of
      the steel. I forced myself to ponder upon the sound of the crescent as it
      should pass across the garment—upon the peculiar thrilling sensation
      which the friction of cloth produces on the nerves. I pondered upon all
      this frivolity until my teeth were on edge.
    &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
      Down—steadily down it crept. I took a frenzied pleasure in
      contrasting its downward with its lateral velocity. To the right—to
      the left—far and wide—with the shriek of a damned spirit! to
      my heart with the stealthy pace of the tiger! I alternately laughed and
      howled as the one or the other idea grew predominant.
    &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
      Down—certainly, relentlessly down! It vibrated within three inches
      of my bosom! I struggled violently, furiously, to free my left arm. This
      was free only from the elbow to the hand. I could reach the latter, from
      the platter beside me, to my mouth, with great effort, but no farther.
      Could I have broken the fastenings above the elbow, I would have seized
      and attempted to arrest the pendulum. I might as well have attempted to
      arrest an avalanche!
    &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
      Down—still unceasingly—still inevitably down! I gasped and
      struggled at each vibration. I shrunk convulsively at its every sweep. My
      eyes followed its outward or upward whirls with the eagerness of the most
      unmeaning despair; they closed themselves spasmodically at the descent,
      although death would have been a relief, oh, how unspeakable! Still I
      quivered in every nerve to think how slight a sinking of the machinery
      would precipitate that keen, glistening axe upon my bosom. It was hope
      that prompted the nerve to quiver—the frame to shrink. It was hope—the
      hope that triumphs on the rack—that whispers to the death-condemned
      even in the dungeons of the Inquisition.
    &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
      I saw that some ten or twelve vibrations would bring the steel in actual
      contact with my robe, and with this observation there suddenly came over
      my spirit all the keen, collected calmness of despair. For the first time
      during many hours—or perhaps days—I thought. It now occurred
      to me that the bandage, or surcingle, which enveloped me, was unique. I
      was tied by no separate cord. The first stroke of the razorlike crescent
      athwart any portion of the band, would so detach it that it might be
      unwound from my person by means of my left hand. But how fearful, in that
      case, the proximity of the steel! The result of the slightest struggle how
      deadly! Was it likely, moreover, that the minions of the torturer had not
      foreseen and provided for this possibility? Was it probable that the
      bandage crossed my bosom in the track of the pendulum? Dreading to find my
      faint, and, as it seemed, my last hope frustrated, I so far elevated my
      head as to obtain a distinct view of my breast. The surcingle enveloped my
      limbs and body close in all directions—save in the path of the
      destroying crescent.
    &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
      Scarcely had I dropped my head back into its original position, when there
      flashed upon my mind what I cannot better describe than as the unformed
      half of that idea of deliverance to which I have previously alluded, and
      of which a moiety only floated indeterminately through my brain when I
      raised food to my burning lips. The whole thought was now present—feeble,
      scarcely sane, scarcely definite,—but still entire. I proceeded at
      once, with the nervous energy of despair, to attempt its execution.
    &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
      For many hours the immediate vicinity of the low framework upon which I
      lay had been literally swarming with rats. They were wild, bold,
      ravenous—their red eyes glaring upon me as if they waited but for
      motionlessness on my part to make me their prey. “To what food,” I
      thought, “have they been accustomed in the well?”
     &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
      They had devoured, in spite of all my efforts to prevent them, all but a
      small remnant of the contents of the dish. I had fallen into an habitual
      see-saw, or wave of the hand about the platter; and, at length, the
      unconscious uniformity of the movement deprived it of effect. In their
      voracity the vermin frequently fastened their sharp fangs in my fingers.
      With the particles of the oily and spicy viand which now remained, I
      thoroughly rubbed the bandage wherever I could reach it; then, raising my
      hand from the floor, I lay breathlessly still.
    &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
      At first the ravenous animals were startled and terrified at the change—at
      the cessation of movement. They shrank alarmedly back; many sought the
      well. But this was only for a moment. I had not counted in vain upon their
      voracity. Observing that I remained without motion, one or two of the
      boldest leaped upon the frame-work, and smelt at the surcingle. This
      seemed the signal for a general rush. Forth from the well they hurried in
      fresh troops. They clung to the wood—they overran it, and leaped in
      hundreds upon my person. The measured movement of the pendulum disturbed
      them not at all. Avoiding its strokes they busied themselves with the
      anointed bandage. They pressed—they swarmed upon me in ever
      accumulating heaps. They writhed upon my throat; their cold lips sought my
      own; I was half stifled by their thronging pressure; disgust, for which
      the world has no name, swelled my bosom, and chilled, with a heavy
      clamminess, my heart. Yet one minute, and I felt that the struggle would
      be over. Plainly I perceived the loosening of the bandage. I knew that in
      more than one place it must be already severed. With a more than human
      resolution I lay still.
    &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
      Nor had I erred in my calculations—nor had I endured in vain. I at
      length felt that I was free. The surcingle hung in ribands from my body.
      But the stroke of the pendulum already pressed upon my bosom. It had
      divided the serge of the robe. It had cut through the linen beneath. Twice
      again it swung, and a sharp sense of pain shot through every nerve. But
      the moment of escape had arrived. At a wave of my hand my deliverers
      hurried tumultuously away. With a steady movement—cautious,
      sidelong, shrinking, and slow—I slid from the embrace of the bandage
      and beyond the reach of the scimitar. For the moment, at least, I was
      free.
    &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
      Free!—and in the grasp of the Inquisition! I had scarcely stepped
      from my wooden bed of horror upon the stone floor of the prison, when the
      motion of the hellish machine ceased and I beheld it drawn up, by some
      invisible force, through the ceiling. This was a lesson which I took
      desperately to heart. My every motion was undoubtedly watched. Free!—I
      had but escaped death in one form of agony, to be delivered unto worse
      than death in some other. With that thought I rolled my eves nervously
      around on the barriers of iron that hemmed me in. Something unusual—some
      change which, at first, I could not appreciate distinctly—it was
      obvious, had taken place in the apartment. For many minutes of a dreamy
      and trembling abstraction, I busied myself in vain, unconnected
      conjecture. During this period, I became aware, for the first time, of the
      origin of the sulphurous light which illumined the cell. It proceeded from
      a fissure, about half an inch in width, extending entirely around the
      prison at the base of the walls, which thus appeared, and were, completely
      separated from the floor. I endeavored, but of course in vain, to look
      through the aperture.
    &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
      As I arose from the attempt, the mystery of the alteration in the chamber
      broke at once upon my understanding. I have observed that, although the
      outlines of the figures upon the walls were sufficiently distinct, yet the
      colors seemed blurred and indefinite. These colors had now assumed, and
      were momentarily assuming, a startling and most intense brilliancy, that
      gave to the spectral and fiendish portraitures an aspect that might have
      thrilled even firmer nerves than my own. Demon eyes, of a wild and ghastly
      vivacity, glared upon me in a thousand directions, where none had been
      visible before, and gleamed with the lurid lustre of a fire that I could
      not force my imagination to regard as unreal.
    &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
&lt;i&gt;Unreal!&lt;/i&gt;—Even while I breathed there came to my nostrils the breath
      of the vapour of heated iron! A suffocating odour pervaded the prison! A
      deeper glow settled each moment in the eyes that glared at my agonies! A
      richer tint of crimson diffused itself over the pictured horrors of blood.
      I panted! I gasped for breath! There could be no doubt of the design of my
      tormentors—oh! most unrelenting! oh! most demoniac of men! I shrank
      from the glowing metal to the centre of the cell. Amid the thought of the
      fiery destruction that impended, the idea of the coolness of the well came
      over my soul like balm. I rushed to its deadly brink. I threw my straining
      vision below. The glare from the enkindled roof illumined its inmost
      recesses. Yet, for a wild moment, did my spirit refuse to comprehend the
      meaning of what I saw. At length it forced—it wrestled its way into
      my soul—it burned itself in upon my shuddering reason. Oh! for
      a voice to speak!—oh! horror!—oh! any horror but this! With a
      shriek, I rushed from the margin, and buried my face in my hands—weeping
      bitterly.
    &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
      The heat rapidly increased, and once again I looked up, shuddering as with
      a fit of the ague. There had been a second change in the cell—and
      now the change was obviously in the form. As before, it was in vain that
      I, at first, endeavoured to appreciate or understand what was taking
      place. But not long was I left in doubt. The Inquisitorial vengeance had
      been hurried by my two-fold escape, and there was to be no more dallying
      with the King of Terrors. The room had been square. I saw that two of its
      iron angles were now acute—two, consequently, obtuse. The fearful
      difference quickly increased with a low rumbling or moaning sound. In an
      instant the apartment had shifted its form into that of a lozenge. But the
      alteration stopped not here—I neither hoped nor desired it to stop. I
      could have clasped the red walls to my bosom as a garment of eternal
      peace. “Death,” I said, “any death but that of the pit!” Fool! might I
      have not known that into the pit it was the object of the burning iron to
      urge me? Could I resist its glow? or, if even that, could I withstand its
      pressure? And now, flatter and flatter grew the lozenge, with a rapidity
      that left me no time for contemplation. Its centre, and of course, its
      greatest width, came just over the yawning gulf. I shrank back—but
      the closing walls pressed me resistlessly onward. At length for my seared
      and writhing body there was no longer an inch of foothold on the firm
      floor of the prison. I struggled no more, but the agony of my soul found
      vent in one loud, long, and final scream of despair. I felt that I
      tottered upon the brink—I averted my eyes—
    &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
      There was a discordant hum of human voices! There was a loud blast as of
      many trumpets! There was a harsh grating as of a thousand thunders! The
      fiery walls rushed back! An outstretched arm caught my own as I fell,
      fainting, into the abyss. It was that of General Lasalle. The French army
      had entered Toledo. The Inquisition was in the hands of its enemies.
    &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;&lt;a id=&#34;chap2.16&#34;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;THE PREMATURE BURIAL&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
      There are certain themes of which the interest is all-absorbing, but which
      are too entirely horrible for the purposes of legitimate fiction. These
      the mere romanticist must eschew, if he do not wish to offend or to
      disgust. They are with propriety handled only when the severity and
      majesty of Truth sanctify and sustain them. We thrill, for example, with
      the most intense of “pleasurable pain” over the accounts of the Passage of
      the Beresina, of the Earthquake at Lisbon, of the Plague at London, of the
      Massacre of St. Bartholomew, or of the stifling of the hundred and
      twenty-three prisoners in the Black Hole at Calcutta. But in these
      accounts it is the fact——it is the reality——it is
      the history which excites. As inventions, we should regard them with
      simple abhorrence.
    &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
      I have mentioned some few of the more prominent and august calamities on
      record; but in these it is the extent, not less than the character of the
      calamity, which so vividly impresses the fancy. I need not remind the
      reader that, from the long and weird catalogue of human miseries, I might
      have selected many individual instances more replete with essential
      suffering than any of these vast generalities of disaster. The true
      wretchedness, indeed—the ultimate woe——is particular,
      not diffuse. That the ghastly extremes of agony are endured by man the
      unit, and never by man the mass——for this let us thank a
      merciful God!
    &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
      To be buried while alive is, beyond question, the most terrific of these
      extremes which has ever fallen to the lot of mere mortality. That it has
      frequently, very frequently, so fallen will scarcely be denied by those
      who think. The boundaries which divide Life from Death are at best shadowy
      and vague. Who shall say where the one ends, and where the other begins?
      We know that there are diseases in which occur total cessations of all the
      apparent functions of vitality, and yet in which these cessations are
      merely suspensions, properly so called. They are only temporary pauses in
      the incomprehensible mechanism. A certain period elapses, and some unseen
      mysterious principle again sets in motion the magic pinions and the wizard
      wheels. The silver cord was not for ever loosed, nor the golden bowl
      irreparably broken. But where, meantime, was the soul?
    &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
      Apart, however, from the inevitable conclusion, &lt;i&gt;a priori&lt;/i&gt; that such causes
      must produce such effects——that the well-known occurrence of
      such cases of suspended animation must naturally give rise, now and then,
      to premature interments—apart from this consideration, we have the
      direct testimony of medical and ordinary experience to prove that a vast
      number of such interments have actually taken place. I might refer at
      once, if necessary, to a hundred well-authenticated instances. One of very
      remarkable character, and of which the circumstances may be fresh in the
      memory of some of my readers, occurred, not very long ago, in the
      neighboring city of Baltimore, where it occasioned a painful, intense, and
      widely-extended excitement. The wife of one of the most respectable
      citizens—a lawyer of eminence and a member of Congress—was
      seized with a sudden and unaccountable illness, which completely baffled
      the skill of her physicians. After much suffering she died, or was
      supposed to die. No one suspected, indeed, or had reason to suspect, that
      she was not actually dead. She presented all the ordinary appearances of
      death. The face assumed the usual pinched and sunken outline. The lips
      were of the usual marble pallor. The eyes were lustreless. There was no
      warmth. Pulsation had ceased. For three days the body was preserved
      unburied, during which it had acquired a stony rigidity. The funeral, in
      short, was hastened, on account of the rapid advance of what was supposed
      to be decomposition.
    &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
      The lady was deposited in her family vault, which, for three subsequent
      years, was undisturbed. At the expiration of this term it was opened for
      the reception of a sarcophagus; but, alas! how fearful a shock awaited
      the husband, who, personally, threw open the door! As its portals swung
      outwardly back, some white-apparelled object fell rattling within his
      arms. It was the skeleton of his wife in her yet unmoulded shroud.
    &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
      A careful investigation rendered it evident that she had revived within
      two days after her entombment; that her struggles within the coffin had
      caused it to fall from a ledge, or shelf to the floor, where it was so
      broken as to permit her escape. A lamp which had been accidentally left,
      full of oil, within the tomb, was found empty; it might have been
      exhausted, however, by evaporation. On the uttermost of the steps which
      led down into the dread chamber was a large fragment of the coffin, with
      which, it seemed, that she had endeavored to arrest attention by striking
      the iron door. While thus occupied, she probably swooned, or possibly
      died, through sheer terror; and, in failing, her shroud became entangled
      in some iron-work which projected interiorly. Thus she remained, and
      thus she rotted, erect.
    &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
      In the year 1810, a case of living inhumation happened in France, attended
      with circumstances which go far to warrant the assertion that truth is,
      indeed, stranger than fiction. The heroine of the story was a Mademoiselle
      Victorine Lafourcade, a young girl of illustrious family, of wealth, and
      of great personal beauty. Among her numerous suitors was Julien Bossuet, a
      poor &lt;i&gt;litterateur&lt;/i&gt;, or journalist of Paris. His talents and general
      amiability had recommended him to the notice of the heiress, by whom he
      seems to have been truly beloved; but her pride of birth decided her,
      finally, to reject him, and to wed a Monsieur Renelle, a banker and a
      diplomatist of some eminence. After marriage, however, this gentleman
      neglected, and, perhaps, even more positively ill-treated her. Having
      passed with him some wretched years, she died—at least her
      condition so closely resembled death as to deceive every one who saw her.
      She was buried——not in a vault, but in an ordinary grave in
      the village of her nativity. Filled with despair, and still inflamed by
      the memory of a profound attachment, the lover journeys from the capital
      to the remote province in which the village lies, with the romantic
      purpose of disinterring the corpse, and possessing himself of its
      luxuriant tresses. He reaches the grave. At midnight he unearths the
      coffin, opens it, and is in the act of detaching the hair, when he is
      arrested by the unclosing of the beloved eyes. In fact, the lady had been
      buried alive. Vitality had not altogether departed, and she was aroused by
      the caresses of her lover from the lethargy which had been mistaken for
      death. He bore her frantically to his lodgings in the village. He employed
      certain powerful restoratives suggested by no little medical learning. In
      fine, she revived. She recognized her preserver. She remained with him
      until, by slow degrees, she fully recovered her original health. Her
      woman’s heart was not adamant, and this last lesson of love sufficed to
      soften it. She bestowed it upon Bossuet. She returned no more to her
      husband, but, concealing from him her resurrection, fled with her lover to
      America. Twenty years afterward, the two returned to France, in the
      persuasion that time had so greatly altered the lady’s appearance that her
      friends would be unable to recognize her. They were mistaken, however,
      for, at the first meeting, Monsieur Renelle did actually recognize and
      make claim to his wife. This claim she resisted, and a judicial tribunal
      sustained her in her resistance, deciding that the peculiar circumstances,
      with the long lapse of years, had extinguished, not only equitably, but
      legally, the authority of the husband.
    &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
      The “Chirurgical Journal” of Leipsic, a periodical of high authority
      and merit, which some American bookseller would do well to translate and
      republish, records in a late number a very distressing event of the
      character in question.
    &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
      An officer of artillery, a man of gigantic stature and of robust health,
      being thrown from an unmanageable horse, received a very severe contusion
      upon the head, which rendered him insensible at once; the skull was
      slightly fractured, but no immediate danger was apprehended. Trepanning
      was accomplished successfully. He was bled, and many other of the ordinary
      means of relief were adopted. Gradually, however, he fell into a more and
      more hopeless state of stupor, and, finally, it was thought that he died.
    &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
      The weather was warm, and he was buried with indecent haste in one of the
      public cemeteries. His funeral took place on Thursday. On the Sunday
      following, the grounds of the cemetery were, as usual, much thronged with
      visitors, and about noon an intense excitement was created by the
      declaration of a peasant that, while sitting upon the grave of the
      officer, he had distinctly felt a commotion of the earth, as if occasioned
      by some one struggling beneath. At first little attention was paid to the
      man’s asseveration; but his evident terror, and the dogged obstinacy with
      which he persisted in his story, had at length their natural effect upon
      the crowd. Spades were hurriedly procured, and the grave, which was
      shamefully shallow, was in a few minutes so far thrown open that the head
      of its occupant appeared. He was then seemingly dead; but he sat nearly
      erect within his coffin, the lid of which, in his furious struggles, he
      had partially uplifted.
    &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
      He was forthwith conveyed to the nearest hospital, and there pronounced to
      be still living, although in an asphytic condition. After some hours he
      revived, recognized individuals of his acquaintance, and, in broken
      sentences spoke of his agonies in the grave.
    &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
      From what he related, it was clear that he must have been conscious of
      life for more than an hour, while inhumed, before lapsing into
      insensibility. The grave was carelessly and loosely filled with an
      exceedingly porous soil; and thus some air was necessarily admitted. He
      heard the footsteps of the crowd overhead, and endeavored to make himself
      heard in turn. It was the tumult within the grounds of the cemetery, he
      said, which appeared to awaken him from a deep sleep, but no sooner was he
      awake than he became fully aware of the awful horrors of his position.
    &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
      This patient, it is recorded, was doing well and seemed to be in a fair
      way of ultimate recovery, but fell a victim to the quackeries of medical
      experiment. The galvanic battery was applied, and he suddenly expired in
      one of those ecstatic paroxysms which, occasionally, it superinduces.
    &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
      The mention of the galvanic battery, nevertheless, recalls to my memory a
      well known and very extraordinary case in point, where its action proved
      the means of restoring to animation a young attorney of London, who had
      been interred for two days. This occurred in 1831, and created, at the
      time, a very profound sensation wherever it was made the subject of
      converse.
    &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
      The patient, Mr. Edward Stapleton, had died, apparently of typhus fever,
      accompanied with some anomalous symptoms which had excited the curiosity
      of his medical attendants. Upon his seeming decease, his friends were
      requested to sanction a post-mortem examination, but declined to permit
      it. As often happens, when such refusals are made, the practitioners
      resolved to disinter the body and dissect it at leisure, in private.
      Arrangements were easily effected with some of the numerous corps of
      body-snatchers, with which London abounds; and, upon the third night after
      the funeral, the supposed corpse was unearthed from a grave eight feet
      deep, and deposited in the opening chamber of one of the private
      hospitals.
    &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
      An incision of some extent had been actually made in the abdomen, when the
      fresh and undecayed appearance of the subject suggested an application of
      the battery. One experiment succeeded another, and the customary effects
      supervened, with nothing to characterize them in any respect, except, upon
      one or two occasions, a more than ordinary degree of life-likeness in the
      convulsive action.
    &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
      It grew late. The day was about to dawn; and it was thought expedient, at
      length, to proceed at once to the dissection. A student, however, was
      especially desirous of testing a theory of his own, and insisted upon
      applying the battery to one of the pectoral muscles. A rough gash was
      made, and a wire hastily brought in contact, when the patient, with a
      hurried but quite unconvulsive movement, arose from the table, stepped
      into the middle of the floor, gazed about him uneasily for a few seconds,
      and then—spoke. What he said was unintelligible, but words were
      uttered; the syllabification was distinct. Having spoken, he fell heavily
      to the floor.
    &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
      For some moments all were paralyzed with awe—but the urgency of the
      case soon restored them their presence of mind. It was seen that Mr.
      Stapleton was alive, although in a swoon. Upon exhibition of ether he
      revived and was rapidly restored to health, and to the society of his
      friends—from whom, however, all knowledge of his resuscitation was
      withheld, until a relapse was no longer to be apprehended. Their wonder—their
      rapturous astonishment—may be conceived.
    &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
      The most thrilling peculiarity of this incident, nevertheless, is involved
      in what Mr. S. himself asserts. He declares that at no period was he
      altogether insensible—that, dully and confusedly, he was aware of
      everything which happened to him, from the moment in which he was
      pronounced dead by his physicians, to that in which he fell swooning to
      the floor of the hospital. “I am alive,” were the uncomprehended words
      which, upon recognizing the locality of the dissecting-room, he had
      endeavored, in his extremity, to utter.
    &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
      It were an easy matter to multiply such histories as these—but I
      forbear—for, indeed, we have no need of such to establish the fact
      that premature interments occur. When we reflect how very rarely, from the
      nature of the case, we have it in our power to detect them, we must admit
      that they may frequently occur without our cognizance. Scarcely, in truth,
      is a graveyard ever encroached upon, for any purpose, to any great extent,
      that skeletons are not found in postures which suggest the most fearful of
      suspicions.
    &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
      Fearful indeed the suspicion—but more fearful the doom! It may be
      asserted, without hesitation, that no event is so terribly well adapted to
      inspire the supremeness of bodily and of mental distress, as is burial
      before death. The unendurable oppression of the lungs—the stifling
      fumes from the damp earth—the clinging to the death garments—the
      rigid embrace of the narrow house—the blackness of the absolute
      Night—the silence like a sea that overwhelms—the unseen but
      palpable presence of the Conqueror Worm—these things, with the
      thoughts of the air and grass above, with memory of dear friends who would
      fly to save us if but informed of our fate, and with consciousness that of
      this fate they can never be informed—that our hopeless portion is
      that of the really dead—these considerations, I say, carry into the
      heart, which still palpitates, a degree of appalling and intolerable
      horror from which the most daring imagination must recoil. We know of
      nothing so agonizing upon Earth—we can dream of nothing half so
      hideous in the realms of the nethermost Hell. And thus all narratives upon
      this topic have an interest profound; an interest, nevertheless, which,
      through the sacred awe of the topic itself, very properly and very
      peculiarly depends upon our conviction of the truth of the matter
      narrated. What I have now to tell is of my own actual knowledge—of
      my own positive and personal experience.
    &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
      For several years I had been subject to attacks of the singular disorder
      which physicians have agreed to term catalepsy, in default of a more
      definitive title. Although both the immediate and the predisposing causes,
      and even the actual diagnosis, of this disease are still mysterious, its
      obvious and apparent character is sufficiently well understood. Its
      variations seem to be chiefly of degree. Sometimes the patient lies, for a
      day only, or even for a shorter period, in a species of exaggerated
      lethargy. He is senseless and externally motionless; but the pulsation of
      the heart is still faintly perceptible; some traces of warmth remain; a
      slight color lingers within the centre of the cheek; and, upon application
      of a mirror to the lips, we can detect a torpid, unequal, and vacillating
      action of the lungs. Then again the duration of the trance is for weeks—even
      for months; while the closest scrutiny, and the most rigorous medical
      tests, fail to establish any material distinction between the state of the
      sufferer and what we conceive of absolute death. Very usually he is saved
      from premature interment solely by the knowledge of his friends that he
      has been previously subject to catalepsy, by the consequent suspicion
      excited, and, above all, by the non-appearance of decay. The advances of
      the malady are, luckily, gradual. The first manifestations, although
      marked, are unequivocal. The fits grow successively more and more
      distinctive, and endure each for a longer term than the preceding. In this
      lies the principal security from inhumation. The unfortunate whose first
      attack should be of the extreme character which is occasionally seen,
      would almost inevitably be consigned alive to the tomb.
    &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
      My own case differed in no important particular from those mentioned in
      medical books. Sometimes, without any apparent cause, I sank, little by
      little, into a condition of semi-syncope, or half swoon; and, in this
      condition, without pain, without ability to stir, or, strictly speaking,
      to think, but with a dull lethargic consciousness of life and of the
      presence of those who surrounded my bed, I remained, until the crisis of
      the disease restored me, suddenly, to perfect sensation. At other times I
      was quickly and impetuously smitten. I grew sick, and numb, and chilly,
      and dizzy, and so fell prostrate at once. Then, for weeks, all was void,
      and black, and silent, and Nothing became the universe. Total annihilation
      could be no more. From these latter attacks I awoke, however, with a
      gradation slow in proportion to the suddenness of the seizure. Just as the
      day dawns to the friendless and houseless beggar who roams the streets
      throughout the long desolate winter night—just so tardily—just
      so wearily—just so cheerily came back the light of the Soul to me.
    &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
      Apart from the tendency to trance, however, my general health appeared to
      be good; nor could I perceive that it was at all affected by the one
      prevalent malady—unless, indeed, an idiosyncrasy in my ordinary
      sleep may be looked upon as superinduced. Upon awaking from slumber, I
      could never gain, at once, thorough possession of my senses, and always
      remained, for many minutes, in much bewilderment and perplexity—the
      mental faculties in general, but the memory in especial, being in a
      condition of absolute abeyance.
    &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
      In all that I endured there was no physical suffering but of moral
      distress an infinitude. My fancy grew charnel, I talked “of worms, of
      tombs, and epitaphs.” I was lost in reveries of death, and the idea of
      premature burial held continual possession of my brain. The ghastly Danger
      to which I was subjected haunted me day and night. In the former, the
      torture of meditation was excessive—in the latter, supreme. When the
      grim Darkness overspread the Earth, then, with every horror of thought, I
      shook—shook as the quivering plumes upon the hearse. When Nature
      could endure wakefulness no longer, it was with a struggle that I
      consented to sleep—for I shuddered to reflect that, upon awaking, I
      might find myself the tenant of a grave. And when, finally, I sank into
      slumber, it was only to rush at once into a world of phantasms, above
      which, with vast, sable, overshadowing wing, hovered, predominant, the one
      sepulchral Idea.
    &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
      From the innumerable images of gloom which thus oppressed me in dreams, I
      select for record but a solitary vision. Methought I was immersed in a
      cataleptic trance of more than usual duration and profundity. Suddenly
      there came an icy hand upon my forehead, and an impatient, gibbering voice
      whispered the word “Arise!” within my ear.
    &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
      I sat erect. The darkness was total. I could not see the figure of him who
      had aroused me. I could call to mind neither the period at which I had
      fallen into the trance, nor the locality in which I then lay. While I
      remained motionless, and busied in endeavors to collect my thought, the
      cold hand grasped me fiercely by the wrist, shaking it petulantly, while
      the gibbering voice said again:
    &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
      “Arise! did I not bid thee arise?”
     &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
      “And who,” I demanded, “art thou?”
     &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
      “I have no name in the regions which I inhabit,” replied the voice,
      mournfully; “I was mortal, but am fiend. I was merciless, but am pitiful.
      Thou dost feel that I shudder. My teeth chatter as I speak, yet it
      is not with the chilliness of the night—of the night without end.
      But this hideousness is insufferable. How canst thou tranquilly sleep? I
      cannot rest for the cry of these great agonies. These sights are more than
      I can bear. Get thee up! Come with me into the outer Night, and let me
      unfold to thee the graves. Is not this a spectacle of woe?—Behold!”
     &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
      I looked; and the unseen figure, which still grasped me by the wrist, had
      caused to be thrown open the graves of all mankind; and from each issued
      the faint phosphoric radiance of decay; so that I could see into the
      innermost recesses, and there view the shrouded bodies in their sad and
      solemn slumbers with the worm. But alas! the real sleepers were fewer, by
      many millions, than those who slumbered not at all; and there was a feeble
      struggling; and there was a general sad unrest; and from out the depths of
      the countless pits there came a melancholy rustling from the garments of
      the buried. And of those who seemed tranquilly to repose, I saw that a
      vast number had changed, in a greater or less degree, the rigid and uneasy
      position in which they had originally been entombed. And the voice again
      said to me as I gazed:
    &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
      “Is it not—oh! is it &lt;i&gt;not&lt;/i&gt; a pitiful sight?” But, before I could
      find words to reply, the figure had ceased to grasp my wrist, the
      phosphoric lights expired, and the graves were closed with a sudden
      violence, while from out them arose a tumult of despairing cries, saying
      again: “Is it not—O, God, is it &lt;i&gt;not&lt;/i&gt; a very pitiful sight?”
     &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
      Phantasies such as these, presenting themselves at night, extended their
      terrific influence far into my waking hours. My nerves became thoroughly
      unstrung, and I fell a prey to perpetual horror. I hesitated to ride, or
      to walk, or to indulge in any exercise that would carry me from home. In
      fact, I no longer dared trust myself out of the immediate presence of
      those who were aware of my proneness to catalepsy, lest, falling into one
      of my usual fits, I should be buried before my real condition could be
      ascertained. I doubted the care, the fidelity of my dearest friends. I
      dreaded that, in some trance of more than customary duration, they might
      be prevailed upon to regard me as irrecoverable. I even went so far as to
      fear that, as I occasioned much trouble, they might be glad to consider
      any very protracted attack as sufficient excuse for getting rid of me
      altogether. It was in vain they endeavored to reassure me by the most
      solemn promises. I exacted the most sacred oaths, that under no
      circumstances they would bury me until decomposition had so materially
      advanced as to render farther preservation impossible. And, even then, my
      mortal terrors would listen to no reason—would accept no
      consolation. I entered into a series of elaborate precautions. Among other
      things, I had the family vault so remodelled as to admit of being readily
      opened from within. The slightest pressure upon a long lever that extended
      far into the tomb would cause the iron portal to fly back. There were
      arrangements also for the free admission of air and light, and convenient
      receptacles for food and water, within immediate reach of the coffin
      intended for my reception. This coffin was warmly and softly padded, and
      was provided with a lid, fashioned upon the principle of the vault-door,
      with the addition of springs so contrived that the feeblest movement of
      the body would be sufficient to set it at liberty. Besides all this, there
      was suspended from the roof of the tomb, a large bell, the rope of which,
      it was designed, should extend through a hole in the coffin, and so be
      fastened to one of the hands of the corpse. But, alas? what avails the
      vigilance against the Destiny of man? Not even these well-contrived
      securities sufficed to save from the uttermost agonies of living
      inhumation, a wretch to these agonies foredoomed!
    &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
      There arrived an epoch—as often before there had arrived—in
      which I found myself emerging from total unconsciousness into the first
      feeble and indefinite sense of existence. Slowly—with a tortoise
      gradation—approached the faint gray dawn of the psychal day. A
      torpid uneasiness. An apathetic endurance of dull pain. No care—no
      hope—no effort. Then, after a long interval, a ringing in the ears;
      then, after a lapse still longer, a prickling or tingling sensation in the
      extremities; then a seemingly eternal period of pleasurable quiescence,
      during which the awakening feelings are struggling into thought; then a
      brief re-sinking into non-entity; then a sudden recovery. At length the
      slight quivering of an eyelid, and immediately thereupon, an electric
      shock of a terror, deadly and indefinite, which sends the blood in
      torrents from the temples to the heart. And now the first positive effort
      to think. And now the first endeavor to remember. And now a partial and
      evanescent success. And now the memory has so far regained its dominion,
      that, in some measure, I am cognizant of my state. I feel that I am not
      awaking from ordinary sleep. I recollect that I have been subject to
      catalepsy. And now, at last, as if by the rush of an ocean, my shuddering
      spirit is overwhelmed by the one grim Danger—by the one spectral and
      ever-prevalent idea.
    &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
      For some minutes after this fancy possessed me, I remained without motion.
      And why? I could not summon courage to move. I dared not make the effort
      which was to satisfy me of my fate—and yet there was something at my
      heart which whispered me it was sure. Despair—such as no other
      species of wretchedness ever calls into being—despair alone urged
      me, after long irresolution, to uplift the heavy lids of my eyes. I
      uplifted them. It was dark—all dark. I knew that the fit was over. I
      knew that the crisis of my disorder had long passed. I knew that I had now
      fully recovered the use of my visual faculties—and yet it was dark—all
      dark—the intense and utter raylessness of the Night that endureth
      for evermore.
    &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
      I endeavored to shriek; and my lips and my parched tongue moved
      convulsively together in the attempt—but no voice issued from the
      cavernous lungs, which oppressed as if by the weight of some incumbent
      mountain, gasped and palpitated, with the heart, at every elaborate and
      struggling inspiration.
    &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
      The movement of the jaws, in this effort to cry aloud, showed me that they
      were bound up, as is usual with the dead. I felt, too, that I lay upon
      some hard substance; and by something similar my sides were, also, closely
      compressed. So far, I had not ventured to stir any of my limbs—but
      now I violently threw up my arms, which had been lying at length, with the
      wrists crossed. They struck a solid wooden substance, which extended above
      my person at an elevation of not more than six inches from my face. I
      could no longer doubt that I reposed within a coffin at last.
    &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
      And now, amid all my infinite miseries, came sweetly the cherub Hope—for
      I thought of my precautions. I writhed, and made spasmodic exertions to
      force open the lid: it would not move. I felt my wrists for the bell-rope:
      it was not to be found. And now the Comforter fled for ever, and a still
      sterner Despair reigned triumphant; for I could not help perceiving the
      absence of the paddings which I had so carefully prepared—and then,
      too, there came suddenly to my nostrils the strong peculiar odor of moist
      earth. The conclusion was irresistible. I was not within the vault. I had
      fallen into a trance while absent from home—while among strangers—when,
      or how, I could not remember—and it was they who had buried me as a
      dog—nailed up in some common coffin—and thrust deep, deep, and
      for ever, into some ordinary and nameless grave.
    &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
      As this awful conviction forced itself, thus, into the innermost chambers
      of my soul, I once again struggled to cry aloud. And in this second
      endeavor I succeeded. A long, wild, and continuous shriek, or yell of
      agony, resounded through the realms of the subterranean Night.
    &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
      “Hillo! hillo, there!” said a gruff voice, in reply.
    &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
      “What the devil’s the matter now!” said a second.
    &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
      “Get out o’ that!” said a third.
    &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
      “What do you mean by yowling in that ere kind of style, like a
      cattymount?” said a fourth; and hereupon I was seized and shaken without
      ceremony, for several minutes, by a junto of very rough-looking
      individuals. They did not arouse me from my slumber—for I was wide
      awake when I screamed—but they restored me to the full possession of
      my memory.
    &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
      This adventure occurred near Richmond, in Virginia. Accompanied by a
      friend, I had proceeded, upon a gunning expedition, some miles down the
      banks of the James River. Night approached, and we were overtaken by a
      storm. The cabin of a small sloop lying at anchor in the stream, and laden
      with garden mould, afforded us the only available shelter. We made the
      best of it, and passed the night on board. I slept in one of the only two
      berths in the vessel—and the berths of a sloop of sixty or twenty
      tons need scarcely be described. That which I occupied had no bedding of
      any kind. Its extreme width was eighteen inches. The distance of its
      bottom from the deck overhead was precisely the same. I found it a matter
      of exceeding difficulty to squeeze myself in. Nevertheless, I slept
      soundly, and the whole of my vision—for it was no dream, and no
      nightmare—arose naturally from the circumstances of my position—from
      my ordinary bias of thought—and from the difficulty, to which I have
      alluded, of collecting my senses, and especially of regaining my memory,
      for a long time after awaking from slumber. The men who shook me were the
      crew of the sloop, and some laborers engaged to unload it. From the load
      itself came the earthly smell. The bandage about the jaws was a silk
      handkerchief in which I had bound up my head, in default of my customary
      nightcap.
    &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
      The tortures endured, however, were indubitably quite equal for the time,
      to those of actual sepulture. They were fearfully—they were
      inconceivably hideous; but out of Evil proceeded Good; for their very
      excess wrought in my spirit an inevitable revulsion. My soul acquired tone—acquired
      temper. I went abroad. I took vigorous exercise. I breathed the free air
      of Heaven. I thought upon other subjects than Death. I discarded my
      medical books. “Buchan” I burned. I read no “Night Thoughts”—no
      fustian about churchyards—no bugaboo tales—such as this. In
      short, I became a new man, and lived a man’s life. From that memorable
      night, I dismissed forever my charnel apprehensions, and with them
      vanished the cataleptic disorder, of which, perhaps, they had been less
      the consequence than the cause.
    &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
      There are moments when, even to the sober eye of Reason, the world of our
      sad Humanity may assume the semblance of a Hell—but the imagination
      of man is no Carathis, to explore with impunity its every cavern. Alas!
      the grim legion of sepulchral terrors cannot be regarded as altogether
      fanciful—but, like the Demons in whose company Afrasiab made his
      voyage down the Oxus, they must sleep, or they will devour us—they
      must be suffered to slumber, or we perish.

&lt;p&gt;
      From his cradle to his grave a gale of prosperity bore my friend Ellison
      along. Nor do I use the word prosperity in its mere worldly sense. I mean
      it as synonymous with happiness. The person of whom I speak seemed born
      for the purpose of foreshadowing the doctrines of Turgot, Price,
      Priestley, and Condorcet—of exemplifying by individual instance what
      has been deemed the chimera of the perfectionists. In the brief existence
      of Ellison I fancy that I have seen refuted the dogma, that in man’s very
      nature lies some hidden principle, the antagonist of bliss. An anxious
      examination of his career has given me to understand that in general, from
      the violation of a few simple laws of humanity arises the wretchedness of
      mankind—that as a species we have in our possession the as yet
      unwrought elements of content—and that, even now, in the present
      darkness and madness of all thought on the great question of the social
      condition, it is not impossible that man, the individual, under certain
      unusual and highly fortuitous conditions, may be happy.
    &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
      With opinions such as these my young friend, too, was fully imbued, and
      thus it is worthy of observation that the uninterrupted enjoyment which
      distinguished his life was, in great measure, the result of preconcert. It
      is indeed evident that with less of the instinctive philosophy which, now
      and then, stands so well in the stead of experience, Mr. Ellison would
      have found himself precipitated, by the very extraordinary success of his
      life, into the common vortex of unhappiness which yawns for those of
      pre-eminent endowments. But it is by no means my object to pen an essay on
      happiness. The ideas of my friend may be summed up in a few words. He
      admitted but four elementary principles, or more strictly, conditions of
      bliss. That which he considered chief was (strange to say!) the simple and
      purely physical one of free exercise in the open air. “The health,” he
      said, “attainable by other means is scarcely worth the name.” He instanced
      the ecstasies of the fox-hunter, and pointed to the tillers of the earth,
      the only people who, as a class, can be fairly considered happier than
      others. His second condition was the love of woman. His third, and most
      difficult of realization, was the contempt of ambition. His fourth was an
      object of unceasing pursuit; and he held that, other things being equal,
      the extent of attainable happiness was in proportion to the spirituality
      of this object.
    &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
      Ellison was remarkable in the continuous profusion of good gifts lavished
      upon him by fortune. In personal grace and beauty he exceeded all men. His
      intellect was of that order to which the acquisition of knowledge is less
      a labor than an intuition and a necessity. His family was one of the most
      illustrious of the empire. His bride was the loveliest and most devoted of
      women. His possessions had been always ample; but on the attainment of his
      majority, it was discovered that one of those extraordinary freaks of fate
      had been played in his behalf which startle the whole social world amid
      which they occur, and seldom fail radically to alter the moral
      constitution of those who are their objects.
    &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
      It appears that about a hundred years before Mr. Ellison’s coming of age,
      there had died, in a remote province, one Mr. Seabright Ellison. This
      gentleman had amassed a princely fortune, and, having no immediate
      connections, conceived the whim of suffering his wealth to accumulate for
      a century after his decease. Minutely and sagaciously directing the
      various modes of investment, he bequeathed the aggregate amount to the
      nearest of blood, bearing the name of Ellison, who should be alive at the
      end of the hundred years. Many attempts had been made to set aside this
      singular bequest; their ex post facto character rendered them abortive;
      but the attention of a jealous government was aroused, and a legislative
      act finally obtained, forbidding all similar accumulations. This act,
      however, did not prevent young Ellison from entering into possession, on
      his twenty-first birthday, as the heir of his ancestor Seabright, of a
      fortune of four hundred and fifty millions of dollars. (*1)
    &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
      When it had become known that such was the enormous wealth inherited,
      there were, of course, many speculations as to the mode of its disposal.
      The magnitude and the immediate availability of the sum bewildered all who
      thought on the topic. The possessor of any appreciable amount of money
      might have been imagined to perform any one of a thousand things. With
      riches merely surpassing those of any citizen, it would have been easy to
      suppose him engaging to supreme excess in the fashionable extravagances of
      his time—or busying himself with political intrigue—or aiming
      at ministerial power—or purchasing increase of nobility—or
      collecting large museums of virtu—or playing the munificent patron
      of letters, of science, of art—or endowing, and bestowing his name
      upon extensive institutions of charity. But for the inconceivable wealth
      in the actual possession of the heir, these objects and all ordinary
      objects were felt to afford too limited a field. Recourse was had to
      figures, and these but sufficed to confound. It was seen that, even at
      three per cent., the annual income of the inheritance amounted to no less
      than thirteen millions and five hundred thousand dollars; which was one
      million and one hundred and twenty-five thousand per month; or thirty-six
      thousand nine hundred and eighty-six per day; or one thousand five hundred
      and forty-one per hour; or six and twenty dollars for every minute that
      flew. Thus the usual track of supposition was thoroughly broken up. Men
      knew not what to imagine. There were some who even conceived that Mr.
      Ellison would divest himself of at least one-half of his fortune, as of
      utterly superfluous opulence—enriching whole troops of his relatives
      by division of his superabundance. To the nearest of these he did, in
      fact, abandon the very unusual wealth which was his own before the
      inheritance.
    &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
      I was not surprised, however, to perceive that he had long made up his
      mind on a point which had occasioned so much discussion to his friends.
      Nor was I greatly astonished at the nature of his decision. In regard to
      individual charities he had satisfied his conscience. In the possibility
      of any improvement, properly so called, being effected by man himself in
      the general condition of man, he had (I am sorry to confess it) little
      faith. Upon the whole, whether happily or unhappily, he was thrown back,
      in very great measure, upon self.
    &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
      In the widest and noblest sense he was a poet. He comprehended, moreover,
      the true character, the august aims, the supreme majesty and dignity of
      the poetic sentiment. The fullest, if not the sole proper satisfaction of
      this sentiment he instinctively felt to lie in the creation of novel forms
      of beauty. Some peculiarities, either in his early education, or in the
      nature of his intellect, had tinged with what is termed materialism all
      his ethical speculations; and it was this bias, perhaps, which led him to
      believe that the most advantageous at least, if not the sole legitimate
      field for the poetic exercise, lies in the creation of novel moods of
      purely physical loveliness. Thus it happened he became neither musician
      nor poet—if we use this latter term in its every-day acceptation. Or
      it might have been that he neglected to become either, merely in pursuance
      of his idea that in contempt of ambition is to be found one of the
      essential principles of happiness on earth. Is it not indeed, possible
      that, while a high order of genius is necessarily ambitious, the highest
      is above that which is termed ambition? And may it not thus happen that
      many far greater than Milton have contentedly remained “mute and
      inglorious?” I believe that the world has never seen—and that,
      unless through some series of accidents goading the noblest order of mind
      into distasteful exertion, the world will never see—that full extent
      of triumphant execution, in the richer domains of art, of which the human
      nature is absolutely capable.
    &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
      Ellison became neither musician nor poet; although no man lived more
      profoundly enamored of music and poetry. Under other circumstances than
      those which invested him, it is not impossible that he would have become a
      painter. Sculpture, although in its nature rigorously poetical was too
      limited in its extent and consequences, to have occupied, at any time,
      much of his attention. And I have now mentioned all the provinces in which
      the common understanding of the poetic sentiment has declared it capable
      of expatiating. But Ellison maintained that the richest, the truest, and
      most natural, if not altogether the most extensive province, had been
      unaccountably neglected. No definition had spoken of the
      landscape-gardener as of the poet; yet it seemed to my friend that the
      creation of the landscape-garden offered to the proper Muse the most
      magnificent of opportunities. Here, indeed, was the fairest field for the
      display of imagination in the endless combining of forms of novel beauty;
      the elements to enter into combination being, by a vast superiority, the
      most glorious which the earth could afford. In the multiform and
      multicolor of the flowers and the trees, he recognised the most direct and
      energetic efforts of Nature at physical loveliness. And in the direction
      or concentration of this effort—or, more properly, in its adaptation
      to the eyes which were to behold it on earth—he perceived that he
      should be employing the best means—laboring to the greatest
      advantage—in the fulfilment, not only of his own destiny as poet,
      but of the august purposes for which the Deity had implanted the poetic
      sentiment in man.
    &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
      “Its adaptation to the eyes which were to behold it on earth.” In his
      explanation of this phraseology, Mr. Ellison did much toward solving what
      has always seemed to me an enigma:—I mean the fact (which none but
      the ignorant dispute) that no such combination of scenery exists in nature
      as the painter of genius may produce. No such paradises are to be found in
      reality as have glowed on the canvas of Claude. In the most enchanting of
      natural landscapes, there will always be found a defect or an excess—many
      excesses and defects. While the component parts may defy, individually,
      the highest skill of the artist, the arrangement of these parts will
      always be susceptible of improvement. In short, no position can be
      attained on the wide surface of the natural earth, from which an
      artistical eye, looking steadily, will not find matter of offence in what
      is termed the “composition” of the landscape. And yet how unintelligible
      is this! In all other matters we are justly instructed to regard nature as
      supreme. With her details we shrink from competition. Who shall presume to
      imitate the colors of the tulip, or to improve the proportions of the lily
      of the valley? The criticism which says, of sculpture or portraiture, that
      here nature is to be exalted or idealized rather than imitated, is in
      error. No pictorial or sculptural combinations of points of human
      liveliness do more than approach the living and breathing beauty. In
      landscape alone is the principle of the critic true; and, having felt its
      truth here, it is but the headlong spirit of generalization which has led
      him to pronounce it true throughout all the domains of art. Having, I say,
      felt its truth here; for the feeling is no affectation or chimera. The
      mathematics afford no more absolute demonstrations than the sentiments of
      his art yields the artist. He not only believes, but positively knows,
      that such and such apparently arbitrary arrangements of matter constitute
      and alone constitute the true beauty. His reasons, however, have not yet
      been matured into expression. It remains for a more profound analysis than
      the world has yet seen, fully to investigate and express them.
      Nevertheless he is confirmed in his instinctive opinions by the voice of
      all his brethren. Let a “composition” be defective; let an emendation be
      wrought in its mere arrangement of form; let this emendation be submitted
      to every artist in the world; by each will its necessity be admitted. And
      even far more than this; in remedy of the defective composition,
      each insulated member of the fraternity would have suggested the identical
      emendation.
    &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
      I repeat that in landscape arrangements alone is the physical nature
      susceptible of exaltation, and that, therefore, her susceptibility of
      improvement at this one point, was a mystery I had been unable to solve.
      My own thoughts on the subject had rested in the idea that the primitive
      intention of nature would have so arranged the earth’s surface as to have
      fulfilled at all points man’s sense of perfection in the beautiful, the
      sublime, or the picturesque; but that this primitive intention had been
      frustrated by the known geological disturbances—disturbances of form
      and color—grouping, in the correction or allaying of which lies the
      soul of art. The force of this idea was much weakened, however, by the
      necessity which it involved of considering the disturbances abnormal and
      unadapted to any purpose. It was Ellison who suggested that they were
      prognostic of death. He thus explained:—Admit the earthly
      immortality of man to have been the first intention. We have then the
      primitive arrangement of the earth’s surface adapted to his blissful
      estate, as not existent but designed. The disturbances were the
      preparations for his subsequently conceived deathful condition.
    &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
      “Now,” said my friend, “what we regard as exaltation of the landscape may
      be really such, as respects only the moral or human point of view. Each
      alteration of the natural scenery may possibly effect a blemish in the
      picture, if we can suppose this picture viewed at large—in mass—from
      some point distant from the earth’s surface, although not beyond the
      limits of its atmosphere. It is easily understood that what might improve
      a closely scrutinized detail, may at the same time injure a general or
      more distantly observed effect. There may be a class of beings, human
      once, but now invisible to humanity, to whom, from afar, our disorder may
      seem order—our unpicturesqueness picturesque; in a word, the
      earth-angels, for whose scrutiny more especially than our own, and for
      whose death-refined appreciation of the beautiful, may have been set
      in array by God the wide landscape-gardens of the hemispheres.”
     &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
      In the course of discussion, my friend quoted some passages from a writer
      on landscape-gardening who has been supposed to have well treated his
      theme:
    &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
      “There are properly but two styles of landscape-gardening, the natural and
      the artificial. One seeks to recall the original beauty of the country, by
      adapting its means to the surrounding scenery, cultivating trees in
      harmony with the hills or plain of the neighboring land; detecting and
      bringing into practice those nice relations of size, proportion, and color
      which, hid from the common observer, are revealed everywhere to the
      experienced student of nature. The result of the natural style of
      gardening, is seen rather in the absence of all defects and incongruities—in
      the prevalence of a healthy harmony and order—than in the creation
      of any special wonders or miracles. The artificial style has as many
      varieties as there are different tastes to gratify. It has a certain
      general relation to the various styles of building. There are the stately
      avenues and retirements of Versailles; Italian terraces; and a various
      mixed old English style, which bears some relation to the domestic Gothic
      or English Elizabethan architecture. Whatever may be said against the
      abuses of the artificial landscape-gardening, a mixture of pure art in a
      garden scene adds to it a great beauty. This is partly pleasing to the
      eye, by the show of order and design, and partly moral. A terrace, with an
      old moss-covered balustrade, calls up at once to the eye the fair forms
      that have passed there in other days. The slightest exhibition of art is
      an evidence of care and human interest.”
     &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
      “From what I have already observed,” said Ellison, “you will understand
      that I reject the idea, here expressed, of recalling the original beauty
      of the country. The original beauty is never so great as that which may be
      introduced. Of course, every thing depends on the selection of a spot with
      capabilities. What is said about detecting and bringing into practice nice
      relations of size, proportion, and color, is one of those mere vaguenesses
      of speech which serve to veil inaccuracy of thought. The phrase quoted may
      mean any thing, or nothing, and guides in no degree. That the true result
      of the natural style of gardening is seen rather in the absence of all
      defects and incongruities than in the creation of any special wonders or
      miracles, is a proposition better suited to the grovelling apprehension of
      the herd than to the fervid dreams of the man of genius. The negative
      merit suggested appertains to that hobbling criticism which, in letters,
      would elevate Addison into apotheosis. In truth, while that virtue which
      consists in the mere avoidance of vice appeals directly to the
      understanding, and can thus be circumscribed in rule, the loftier virtue,
      which flames in creation, can be apprehended in its results alone. Rule
      applies but to the merits of denial—to the excellencies which
      refrain. Beyond these, the critical art can but suggest. We may be
      instructed to build a “Cato,” but we are in vain told how to conceive a
      Parthenon or an “Inferno.” The thing done, however; the wonder
      accomplished; and the capacity for apprehension becomes universal. The
      sophists of the negative school who, through inability to create, have
      scoffed at creation, are now found the loudest in applause. What, in its
      chrysalis condition of principle, affronted their demure reason, never
      fails, in its maturity of accomplishment, to extort admiration from their
      instinct of beauty.
    &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
      “The author’s observations on the artificial style,” continued Ellison,
      “are less objectionable. A mixture of pure art in a garden scene adds to
      it a great beauty. This is just; as also is the reference to the sense of
      human interest. The principle expressed is incontrovertible—but
      there may be something beyond it. There may be an object in keeping with
      the principle—an object unattainable by the means ordinarily
      possessed by individuals, yet which, if attained, would lend a charm to
      the landscape-garden far surpassing that which a sense of merely human
      interest could bestow. A poet, having very unusual pecuniary resources,
      might, while retaining the necessary idea of art or culture, or, as our
      author expresses it, of interest, so imbue his designs at once with extent
      and novelty of beauty, as to convey the sentiment of spiritual
      interference. It will be seen that, in bringing about such result, he
      secures all the advantages of interest or design, while relieving his work
      of the harshness or technicality of the worldly art. In the most rugged of
      wildernesses—in the most savage of the scenes of pure nature—there
      is apparent the art of a creator; yet this art is apparent to reflection
      only; in no respect has it the obvious force of a feeling. Now let us
      suppose this sense of the Almighty design to be one step depressed—to
      be brought into something like harmony or consistency with the sense of
      human art—to form an intermedium between the two:—let us
      imagine, for example, a landscape whose combined vastness and
      definitiveness—whose united beauty, magnificence, and strangeness,
      shall convey the idea of care, or culture, or superintendence, on the part
      of beings superior, yet akin to humanity—then the sentiment of
      interest is preserved, while the art intervolved is made to assume the air
      of an intermediate or secondary nature—a nature which is not God,
      nor an emanation from God, but which still is nature in the sense of the
      handiwork of the angels that hover between man and God.”
     &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
      It was in devoting his enormous wealth to the embodiment of a vision such
      as this—in the free exercise in the open air ensured by the personal
      superintendence of his plans—in the unceasing object which these
      plans afforded—in the high spirituality of the object—in the
      contempt of ambition which it enabled him truly to feel—in the
      perennial springs with which it gratified, without possibility of
      satiating, that one master passion of his soul, the thirst for beauty,
      above all, it was in the sympathy of a woman, not unwomanly, whose
      loveliness and love enveloped his existence in the purple atmosphere of
      Paradise, that Ellison thought to find, and found, exemption from the
      ordinary cares of humanity, with a far greater amount of positive
      happiness than ever glowed in the rapt day-dreams of De Staël.
    &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
      I despair of conveying to the reader any distinct conception of the
      marvels which my friend did actually accomplish. I wish to describe, but
      am disheartened by the difficulty of description, and hesitate between
      detail and generality. Perhaps the better course will be to unite the two
      in their extremes.
    &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
      Mr. Ellison’s first step regarded, of course, the choice of a locality,
      and scarcely had he commenced thinking on this point, when the luxuriant
      nature of the Pacific Islands arrested his attention. In fact, he had made
      up his mind for a voyage to the South Seas, when a night’s reflection
      induced him to abandon the idea. “Were I misanthropic,” he said, “such a
      locale would suit me. The thoroughness of its insulation and seclusion,
      and the difficulty of ingress and egress, would in such case be the charm
      of charms; but as yet I am not Timon. I wish the composure but not the
      depression of solitude. There must remain with me a certain control over
      the extent and duration of my repose. There will be frequent hours in
      which I shall need, too, the sympathy of the poetic in what I have done.
      Let me seek, then, a spot not far from a populous city—whose
      vicinity, also, will best enable me to execute my plans.”
     &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
      In search of a suitable place so situated, Ellison travelled for several
      years, and I was permitted to accompany him. A thousand spots with which I
      was enraptured he rejected without hesitation, for reasons which satisfied
      me, in the end, that he was right. We came at length to an elevated
      table-land of wonderful fertility and beauty, affording a panoramic
      prospect very little less in extent than that of Aetna, and, in Ellison’s
      opinion as well as my own, surpassing the far-famed view from that
      mountain in all the true elements of the picturesque.
    &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
      “I am aware,” said the traveller, as he drew a sigh of deep delight after
      gazing on this scene, entranced, for nearly an hour, “I know that here, in
      my circumstances, nine-tenths of the most fastidious of men would rest
      content. This panorama is indeed glorious, and I should rejoice in it but
      for the excess of its glory. The taste of all the architects I have ever
      known leads them, for the sake of ‘prospect,’ to put up buildings on
      hill-tops. The error is obvious. Grandeur in any of its moods, but
      especially in that of extent, startles, excites—and then fatigues,
      depresses. For the occasional scene nothing can be better—for the
      constant view nothing worse. And, in the constant view, the most
      objectionable phase of grandeur is that of extent; the worst phase of
      extent, that of distance. It is at war with the sentiment and with the
      sense of seclusion—the sentiment and sense which we seek to humor in
      ‘retiring to the country.’ In looking from the summit of a mountain we
      cannot help feeling abroad in the world. The heart-sick avoid distant
      prospects as a pestilence.”
     &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
      It was not until toward the close of the fourth year of our search that we
      found a locality with which Ellison professed himself satisfied. It is, of
      course, needless to say where was the locality. The late death of my
      friend, in causing his domain to be thrown open to certain classes of
      visitors, has given to Arnheim a species of secret and subdued if not
      solemn celebrity, similar in kind, although infinitely superior in degree,
      to that which so long distinguished Fonthill.
    &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
      The usual approach to Arnheim was by the river. The visitor left the city
      in the early morning. During the forenoon he passed between shores of a
      tranquil and domestic beauty, on which grazed innumerable sheep, their
      white fleeces spotting the vivid green of rolling meadows. By degrees the
      idea of cultivation subsided into that of merely pastoral care. This
      slowly became merged in a sense of retirement—this again in a
      consciousness of solitude. As the evening approached, the channel grew
      more narrow; the banks more and more precipitous; and these latter were
      clothed in rich, more profuse, and more sombre foliage. The water
      increased in transparency. The stream took a thousand turns, so that at no
      moment could its gleaming surface be seen for a greater distance than a
      furlong. At every instant the vessel seemed imprisoned within an enchanted
      circle, having insuperable and impenetrable walls of foliage, a roof of
      ultramarine satin, and no floor—the keel balancing itself with
      admirable nicety on that of a phantom bark which, by some accident having
      been turned upside down, floated in constant company with the substantial
      one, for the purpose of sustaining it. The channel now became a gorge—although
      the term is somewhat inapplicable, and I employ it merely because the
      language has no word which better represents the most striking—not
      the most distinctive—feature of the scene. The character of gorge
      was maintained only in the height and parallelism of the shores; it was
      lost altogether in their other traits. The walls of the ravine (through
      which the clear water still tranquilly flowed) arose to an elevation of a
      hundred and occasionally of a hundred and fifty feet, and inclined so much
      toward each other as, in a great measure, to shut out the light of day;
      while the long plume-like moss which depended densely from the
      intertwining shrubberies overhead, gave the whole chasm an air of funereal
      gloom. The windings became more frequent and intricate, and seemed often
      as if returning in upon themselves, so that the voyager had long lost all
      idea of direction. He was, moreover, enwrapt in an exquisite sense of the
      strange. The thought of nature still remained, but her character seemed to
      have undergone modification, there was a weird symmetry, a thrilling
      uniformity, a wizard propriety in these her works. Not a dead branch—not
      a withered leaf—not a stray pebble—not a patch of the brown
      earth was anywhere visible. The crystal water welled up against the clean
      granite, or the unblemished moss, with a sharpness of outline that
      delighted while it bewildered the eye.
    &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
      Having threaded the mazes of this channel for some hours, the gloom
      deepening every moment, a sharp and unexpected turn of the vessel brought
      it suddenly, as if dropped from heaven, into a circular basin of very
      considerable extent when compared with the width of the gorge. It was
      about two hundred yards in diameter, and girt in at all points but one—that
      immediately fronting the vessel as it entered—by hills equal in
      general height to the walls of the chasm, although of a thoroughly
      different character. Their sides sloped from the water’s edge at an angle
      of some forty-five degrees, and they were clothed from base to summit—not
      a perceptible point escaping—in a drapery of the most gorgeous
      flower-blossoms; scarcely a green leaf being visible among the sea of
      odorous and fluctuating color. This basin was of great depth, but so
      transparent was the water that the bottom, which seemed to consist of a
      thick mass of small round alabaster pebbles, was distinctly visible by
      glimpses—that is to say, whenever the eye could permit itself not to
      see, far down in the inverted heaven, the duplicate blooming of the hills.
      On these latter there were no trees, nor even shrubs of any size. The
      impressions wrought on the observer were those of richness, warmth, color,
      quietude, uniformity, softness, delicacy, daintiness, voluptuousness, and
      a miraculous extremeness of culture that suggested dreams of a new race of
      fairies, laborious, tasteful, magnificent, and fastidious; but as the eye
      traced upward the myriad-tinted slope, from its sharp junction with the
      water to its vague termination amid the folds of overhanging cloud, it
      became, indeed, difficult not to fancy a panoramic cataract of rubies,
      sapphires, opals, and golden onyxes, rolling silently out of the sky.
    &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
      The visitor, shooting suddenly into this bay from out the gloom of the
      ravine, is delighted but astounded by the full orb of the declining sun,
      which he had supposed to be already far below the horizon, but which now
      confronts him, and forms the sole termination of an otherwise limitless
      vista seen through another chasm-like rift in the hills.
    &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
      But here the voyager quits the vessel which has borne him so far, and
      descends into a light canoe of ivory, stained with arabesque devices in
      vivid scarlet, both within and without. The poop and beak of this boat
      arise high above the water, with sharp points, so that the general form is
      that of an irregular crescent. It lies on the surface of the bay with the
      proud grace of a swan. On its ermined floor reposes a single feathery
      paddle of satin-wood; but no oarsmen or attendant is to be seen. The guest
      is bidden to be of good cheer—that the fates will take care of him.
      The larger vessel disappears, and he is left alone in the canoe, which
      lies apparently motionless in the middle of the lake. While he considers
      what course to pursue, however, he becomes aware of a gentle movement in
      the fairy bark. It slowly swings itself around until its prow points
      toward the sun. It advances with a gentle but gradually accelerated
      velocity, while the slight ripples it creates seem to break about the
      ivory side in divinest melody—seem to offer the only possible explanation
      of the soothing yet melancholy music for whose unseen origin the
      bewildered voyager looks around him in vain.
    &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
      The canoe steadily proceeds, and the rocky gate of the vista is
      approached, so that its depths can be more distinctly seen. To the right
      arise a chain of lofty hills rudely and luxuriantly wooded. It is
      observed, however, that the trait of exquisite cleanness where the bank
      dips into the water, still prevails. There is not one token of the usual
      river &lt;i&gt;débris&lt;/i&gt;. To the left the character of the scene is softer and more
      obviously artificial. Here the bank slopes upward from the stream in a
      very gentle ascent, forming a broad sward of grass of a texture resembling
      nothing so much as velvet, and of a brilliancy of green which would bear
      comparison with the tint of the purest emerald. This plateau varies in
      width from ten to three hundred yards; reaching from the river-bank to a
      wall, fifty feet high, which extends, in an infinity of curves, but
      following the general direction of the river, until lost in the distance
      to the westward. This wall is of one continuous rock, and has been formed
      by cutting perpendicularly the once rugged precipice of the stream’s
      southern bank, but no trace of the labor has been suffered to remain. The
      chiselled stone has the hue of ages, and is profusely overhung and
      overspread with the ivy, the coral honeysuckle, the eglantine, and the
      clematis. The uniformity of the top and bottom lines of the wall is fully
      relieved by occasional trees of gigantic height, growing singly or in
      small groups, both along the plateau and in the domain behind the wall,
      but in close proximity to it; so that frequent limbs (of the black walnut
      especially) reach over and dip their pendent extremities into the water.
      Farther back within the domain, the vision is impeded by an impenetrable
      screen of foliage.
    &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
      These things are observed during the canoe’s gradual approach to what I
      have called the gate of the vista. On drawing nearer to this, however, its
      chasm-like appearance vanishes; a new outlet from the bay is discovered to
      the left—in which direction the wall is also seen to sweep, still
      following the general course of the stream. Down this new opening the eye
      cannot penetrate very far; for the stream, accompanied by the wall, still
      bends to the left, until both are swallowed up by the leaves.
    &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
      The boat, nevertheless, glides magically into the winding channel; and
      here the shore opposite the wall is found to resemble that opposite the
      wall in the straight vista. Lofty hills, rising occasionally into
      mountains, and covered with vegetation in wild luxuriance, still shut in
      the scene.
    &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
      Floating gently onward, but with a velocity slightly augmented, the
      voyager, after many short turns, finds his progress apparently barred by a
      gigantic gate or rather door of burnished gold, elaborately carved and
      fretted, and reflecting the direct rays of the now fast-sinking sun with
      an effulgence that seems to wreath the whole surrounding forest in flames.
      This gate is inserted in the lofty wall; which here appears to cross the
      river at right angles. In a few moments, however, it is seen that the main
      body of the water still sweeps in a gentle and extensive curve to the
      left, the wall following it as before, while a stream of considerable
      volume, diverging from the principal one, makes its way, with a slight
      ripple, under the door, and is thus hidden from sight. The canoe falls
      into the lesser channel and approaches the gate. Its ponderous wings are
      slowly and musically expanded. The boat glides between them, and commences
      a rapid descent into a vast amphitheatre entirely begirt with purple
      mountains, whose bases are laved by a gleaming river throughout the full
      extent of their circuit. Meantime the whole Paradise of Arnheim bursts
      upon the view. There is a gush of entrancing melody; there is an
      oppressive sense of strange sweet odor;—there is a dream-like
      intermingling to the eye of tall slender Eastern trees—bosky
      shrubberies—flocks of golden and crimson birds—lily-fringed
      lakes—meadows of violets, tulips, poppies, hyacinths, and tuberoses—long
      intertangled lines of silver streamlets—and, upspringing confusedly
      from amid all, a mass of semi-Gothic, semi-Saracenic architecture
      sustaining itself by miracle in mid-air, glittering in the red sunlight
      with a hundred oriels, minarets, and pinnacles; and seeming the phantom
      handiwork, conjointly, of the Sylphs, of the Fairies, of the Genii and of
      the Gnomes.

A Pendant to “The Domain of Arnheim”
 &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
      During A pedestrian trip last summer, through one or two of the river
      counties of New York, I found myself, as the day declined, somewhat
      embarrassed about the road I was pursuing. The land undulated very
      remarkably; and my path, for the last hour, had wound about and about so
      confusedly, in its effort to keep in the valleys, that I no longer knew in
      what direction lay the sweet village of B——, where I had
      determined to stop for the night. The sun had scarcely shone—strictly
      speaking—during the day, which nevertheless, had been unpleasantly
      warm. A smoky mist, resembling that of the Indian summer, enveloped all
      things, and of course, added to my uncertainty. Not that I cared much
      about the matter. If I did not hit upon the village before sunset, or even
      before dark, it was more than possible that a little Dutch farmhouse, or
      something of that kind, would soon make its appearance—although, in
      fact, the neighborhood (perhaps on account of being more picturesque than
      fertile) was very sparsely inhabited. At all events, with my knapsack for
      a pillow, and my hound as a sentry, a bivouac in the open air was just the
      thing which would have amused me. I sauntered on, therefore, quite at ease—Ponto
      taking charge of my gun—until at length, just as I had begun to
      consider whether the numerous little glades that led hither and thither,
      were intended to be paths at all, I was conducted by one of them into an
      unquestionable carriage track. There could be no mistaking it. The traces
      of light wheels were evident; and although the tall shrubberies and
      overgrown undergrowth met overhead, there was no obstruction whatever
      below, even to the passage of a Virginian mountain wagon—the most
      aspiring vehicle, I take it, of its kind. The road, however, except in
      being open through the wood—if wood be not too weighty a name for
      such an assemblage of light trees—and except in the particulars of
      evident wheel-tracks—bore no resemblance to any road I had before
      seen. The tracks of which I speak were but faintly perceptible—having
      been impressed upon the firm, yet pleasantly moist surface of—what
      looked more like green Genoese velvet than any thing else. It was grass,
      clearly—but grass such as we seldom see out of England—so
      short, so thick, so even, and so vivid in color. Not a single impediment
      lay in the wheel-route—not even a chip or dead twig. The stones that
      once obstructed the way had been carefully &lt;i&gt;placed&lt;/i&gt;—not thrown—along
      the sides of the lane, so as to define its boundaries at bottom with a
      kind of half-precise, half-negligent, and wholly picturesque definition.
      Clumps of wild flowers grew everywhere, luxuriantly, in the interspaces.
    &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
      What to make of all this, of course I knew not. Here was art undoubtedly—that
      did not surprise me—all roads, in the ordinary sense, are works of
      art; nor can I say that there was much to wonder at in the mere excess of
      art manifested; all that seemed to have been done, might have been done
      here—with such natural “capabilities” (as they have it in the books
      on Landscape Gardening)—with very little labor and expense. No; it
      was not the amount but the character of the art which caused me to take a
      seat on one of the blossomy stones and gaze up and down this fairy-like
      avenue for half an hour or more in bewildered admiration. One thing became
      more and more evident the longer I gazed: an artist, and one with a most
      scrupulous eye for form, had superintended all these arrangements. The
      greatest care had been taken to preserve a due medium between the neat and
      graceful on the one hand, and the pittoresque, in the true sense of the
      Italian term, on the other. There were few straight, and no long
      uninterrupted lines. The same effect of curvature or of color appeared
      twice, usually, but not oftener, at any one point of view. Everywhere was
      variety in uniformity. It was a piece of “composition,” in which the most
      fastidiously critical taste could scarcely have suggested an emendation.
    &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
      I had turned to the right as I entered this road, and now, arising, I
      continued in the same direction. The path was so serpentine, that at no
      moment could I trace its course for more than two or three paces in
      advance. Its character did not undergo any material change.
    &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
      Presently the murmur of water fell gently upon my ear—and in a few
      moments afterward, as I turned with the road somewhat more abruptly than
      hitherto, I became aware that a building of some kind lay at the foot of a
      gentle declivity just before me. I could see nothing distinctly on account
      of the mist which occupied all the little valley below. A gentle breeze,
      however, now arose, as the sun was about descending; and while I remained
      standing on the brow of the slope, the fog gradually became dissipated
      into wreaths, and so floated over the scene.
    &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
      As it came fully into view—thus gradually as I describe it—piece
      by piece, here a tree, there a glimpse of water, and here again the summit
      of a chimney, I could scarcely help fancying that the whole was one of the
      ingenious illusions sometimes exhibited under the name of “vanishing
      pictures.”
     &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
      By the time, however, that the fog had thoroughly disappeared, the sun had
      made its way down behind the gentle hills, and thence, as if with a slight
      chassez to the south, had come again fully into sight, glaring with a
      purplish lustre through a chasm that entered the valley from the west.
      Suddenly, therefore—and as if by the hand of magic—this whole
      valley and every thing in it became brilliantly visible.
    &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
      The first &lt;i&gt;coup d’œil&lt;/i&gt;, as the sun slid into the position described,
      impressed me very much as I have been impressed, when a boy, by the
      concluding scene of some well-arranged theatrical spectacle or melodrama.
      Not even the monstrosity of color was wanting; for the sunlight came out
      through the chasm, tinted all orange and purple; while the vivid green of
      the grass in the valley was reflected more or less upon all objects from
      the curtain of vapor that still hung overhead, as if loth to take its
      total departure from a scene so enchantingly beautiful.
    &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
      The little vale into which I thus peered down from under the fog canopy
      could not have been more than four hundred yards long; while in breadth it
      varied from fifty to one hundred and fifty or perhaps two hundred. It was
      most narrow at its northern extremity, opening out as it tended
      southwardly, but with no very precise regularity. The widest portion was
      within eighty yards of the southern extreme. The slopes which encompassed
      the vale could not fairly be called hills, unless at their northern face.
      Here a precipitous ledge of granite arose to a height of some ninety feet;
      and, as I have mentioned, the valley at this point was not more than fifty
      feet wide; but as the visitor proceeded southwardly from the cliff, he
      found on his right hand and on his left, declivities at once less high,
      less precipitous, and less rocky. All, in a word, sloped and softened to
      the south; and yet the whole vale was engirdled by eminences, more or less
      high, except at two points. One of these I have already spoken of. It lay
      considerably to the north of west, and was where the setting sun made its
      way, as I have before described, into the amphitheatre, through a cleanly
      cut natural cleft in the granite embankment; this fissure might have been
      ten yards wide at its widest point, so far as the eye could trace it. It
      seemed to lead up, up like a natural causeway, into the recesses of
      unexplored mountains and forests. The other opening was directly at the
      southern end of the vale. Here, generally, the slopes were nothing more
      than gentle inclinations, extending from east to west about one hundred
      and fifty yards. In the middle of this extent was a depression, level with
      the ordinary floor of the valley. As regards vegetation, as well as in
      respect to every thing else, the scene softened and sloped to the south.
      To the north—on the craggy precipice—a few paces from the
      verge—up sprang the magnificent trunks of numerous hickories, black
      walnuts, and chestnuts, interspersed with occasional oak; and the strong
      lateral branches thrown out by the walnuts especially, spread far over the
      edge of the cliff. Proceeding southwardly, the explorer saw, at first, the
      same class of trees, but less and less lofty and Salvatorish in character;
      then he saw the gentler elm, succeeded by the sassafras and locust—these
      again by the softer linden, red-bud, catalpa, and maple—these yet
      again by still more graceful and more modest varieties. The whole face of
      the southern declivity was covered with wild shrubbery alone—an
      occasional silver willow or white poplar excepted. In the bottom of the
      valley itself—(for it must be borne in mind that the vegetation
      hitherto mentioned grew only on the cliffs or hillsides)—were to be
      seen three insulated trees. One was an elm of fine size and exquisite
      form: it stood guard over the southern gate of the vale. Another was a
      hickory, much larger than the elm, and altogether a much finer tree,
      although both were exceedingly beautiful: it seemed to have taken charge
      of the northwestern entrance, springing from a group of rocks in the very
      jaws of the ravine, and throwing its graceful body, at an angle of nearly
      forty-five degrees, far out into the sunshine of the amphitheatre. About
      thirty yards east of this tree stood, however, the pride of the valley,
      and beyond all question the most magnificent tree I have ever seen,
      unless, perhaps, among the cypresses of the Itchiatuckanee. It was a
      triple-stemmed tulip-tree—the Liriodendron Tulipiferum—one of
      the natural order of magnolias. Its three trunks separated from the parent
      at about three feet from the soil, and diverging very slightly and
      gradually, were not more than four feet apart at the point where the
      largest stem shot out into foliage: this was at an elevation of about
      eighty feet. The whole height of the principal division was one hundred
      and twenty feet. Nothing can surpass in beauty the form, or the glossy,
      vivid green of the leaves of the tulip-tree. In the present instance they
      were fully eight inches wide; but their glory was altogether eclipsed by
      the gorgeous splendor of the profuse blossoms. Conceive, closely
      congregated, a million of the largest and most resplendent tulips! Only
      thus can the reader get any idea of the picture I would convey. And then
      the stately grace of the clean, delicately-granulated columnar stems, the
      largest four feet in diameter, at twenty from the ground. The innumerable
      blossoms, mingling with those of other trees scarcely less beautiful,
      although infinitely less majestic, filled the valley with more than
      Arabian perfumes.
    &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
      The general floor of the amphitheatre was grass of the same character as
      that I had found in the road; if anything, more deliciously soft, thick,
      velvety, and miraculously green. It was hard to conceive how all this
      beauty had been attained.
    &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
      I have spoken of two openings into the vale. From the one to the northwest
      issued a rivulet, which came, gently murmuring and slightly foaming, down
      the ravine, until it dashed against the group of rocks out of which sprang
      the insulated hickory. Here, after encircling the tree, it passed on a
      little to the north of east, leaving the tulip tree some twenty feet to
      the south, and making no decided alteration in its course until it came
      near the midway between the eastern and western boundaries of the valley.
      At this point, after a series of sweeps, it turned off at right angles and
      pursued a generally southern direction meandering as it went—until
      it became lost in a small lake of irregular figure (although roughly
      oval), that lay gleaming near the lower extremity of the vale. This
      lakelet was, perhaps, a hundred yards in diameter at its widest part. No
      crystal could be clearer than its waters. Its bottom, which could be
      distinctly seen, consisted altogether, of pebbles brilliantly white. Its
      banks, of the emerald grass already described, rounded, rather than
      sloped, off into the clear heaven below; and so clear was this heaven, so
      perfectly, at times, did it reflect all objects above it, that where the
      true bank ended and where the mimic one commenced, it was a point of no
      little difficulty to determine. The trout, and some other varieties of
      fish, with which this pond seemed to be almost inconveniently crowded, had
      all the appearance of veritable flying-fish. It was almost impossible to
      believe that they were not absolutely suspended in the air. A light birch
      canoe that lay placidly on the water, was reflected in its minutest fibres
      with a fidelity unsurpassed by the most exquisitely polished mirror. A
      small island, fairly laughing with flowers in full bloom, and affording
      little more space than just enough for a picturesque little building,
      seemingly a fowl-house—arose from the lake not far from its northern
      shore—to which it was connected by means of an inconceivably light-looking
      and yet very primitive bridge. It was formed of a single, broad and thick
      plank of the tulip wood. This was forty feet long, and spanned the
      interval between shore and shore with a slight but very perceptible arch,
      preventing all oscillation. From the southern extreme of the lake issued a
      continuation of the rivulet, which, after meandering for, perhaps, thirty
      yards, finally passed through the “depression” (already described) in the
      middle of the southern declivity, and tumbling down a sheer precipice of a
      hundred feet, made its devious and unnoticed way to the Hudson.
    &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
      The lake was deep—at some points thirty feet—but the rivulet
      seldom exceeded three, while its greatest width was about eight. Its
      bottom and banks were as those of the pond—if a defect could have
      been attributed, in point of picturesqueness, it was that of excessive
      neatness.
    &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
      The expanse of the green turf was relieved, here and there, by an
      occasional showy shrub, such as the hydrangea, or the common snowball, or
      the aromatic seringa; or, more frequently, by a clump of geraniums
      blossoming gorgeously in great varieties. These latter grew in pots which
      were carefully buried in the soil, so as to give the plants the appearance
      of being indigenous. Besides all this, the lawn’s velvet was exquisitely
      spotted with sheep—a considerable flock of which roamed about the
      vale, in company with three tamed deer, and a vast number of
      brilliantly-plumed ducks. A very large mastiff seemed to be in vigilant
      attendance upon these animals, each and all.
    &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
      Along the eastern and western cliffs—where, toward the upper portion
      of the amphitheatre, the boundaries were more or less precipitous—grew
      ivy in great profusion—so that only here and there could even a
      glimpse of the naked rock be obtained. The northern precipice, in like
      manner, was almost entirely clothed by grape-vines of rare luxuriance;
      some springing from the soil at the base of the cliff, and others from
      ledges on its face.
    &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
      The slight elevation which formed the lower boundary of this little
      domain, was crowned by a neat stone wall, of sufficient height to prevent
      the escape of the deer. Nothing of the fence kind was observable
      elsewhere; for nowhere else was an artificial enclosure needed:—any
      stray sheep, for example, which should attempt to make its way out of the
      vale by means of the ravine, would find its progress arrested, after a few
      yards’ advance, by the precipitous ledge of rock over which tumbled the
      cascade that had arrested my attention as I first drew near the domain. In
      short, the only ingress or egress was through a gate occupying a rocky
      pass in the road, a few paces below the point at which I stopped to
      reconnoitre the scene.
    &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
      I have described the brook as meandering very irregularly through the
      whole of its course. Its two general directions, as I have said, were
      first from west to east, and then from north to south. At the turn, the
      stream, sweeping backward, made an almost circular loop, so as to form a
      peninsula which was very nearly an island, and which included about the
      sixteenth of an acre. On this peninsula stood a dwelling-house—and
      when I say that this house, like the infernal terrace seen by Vathek,
      “etait d’une architecture inconnue dans les annales de la terre,” I mean,
      merely, that its tout ensemble struck me with the keenest sense of
      combined novelty and propriety—in a word, of poetry—(for, than
      in the words just employed, I could scarcely give, of poetry in the
      abstract, a more rigorous definition)—and I do not mean that merely
      outre was perceptible in any respect.
    &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
      In fact nothing could well be more simple—more utterly unpretending
      than this cottage. Its marvellous effect lay altogether in its artistic
      arrangement as a picture. I could have fancied, while I looked at it, that
      some eminent landscape-painter had built it with his brush.
    &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
      The point of view from which I first saw the valley, was not altogether,
      although it was nearly, the best point from which to survey the house. I
      will therefore describe it as I afterwards saw it—from a position on
      the stone wall at the southern extreme of the amphitheatre.
    &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
      The main building was about twenty-four feet long and sixteen broad—certainly
      not more. Its total height, from the ground to the apex of the roof, could
      not have exceeded eighteen feet. To the west end of this structure was
      attached one about a third smaller in all its proportions:—the line
      of its front standing back about two yards from that of the larger house,
      and the line of its roof, of course, being considerably depressed below
      that of the roof adjoining. At right angles to these buildings, and from
      the rear of the main one—not exactly in the middle—extended a
      third compartment, very small—being, in general, one-third less than
      the western wing. The roofs of the two larger were very steep—sweeping
      down from the ridge-beam with a long concave curve, and extending at least
      four feet beyond the walls in front, so as to form the roofs of two
      piazzas. These latter roofs, of course, needed no support; but as they had
      the air of needing it, slight and perfectly plain pillars were inserted at
      the corners alone. The roof of the northern wing was merely an extension
      of a portion of the main roof. Between the chief building and western wing
      arose a very tall and rather slender square chimney of hard Dutch bricks,
      alternately black and red:—a slight cornice of projecting bricks at
      the top. Over the gables the roofs also projected very much:—in the
      main building about four feet to the east and two to the west. The
      principal door was not exactly in the main division, being a little to the
      east—while the two windows were to the west. These latter did not
      extend to the floor, but were much longer and narrower than usual—they
      had single shutters like doors—the panes were of lozenge form, but
      quite large. The door itself had its upper half of glass, also in lozenge
      panes—a movable shutter secured it at night. The door to the west
      wing was in its gable, and quite simple—a single window looked out
      to the south. There was no external door to the north wing, and it also
      had only one window to the east.
    &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
      The blank wall of the eastern gable was relieved by stairs (with a
      balustrade) running diagonally across it—the ascent being from the
      south. Under cover of the widely projecting eave these steps gave access
      to a door leading to the garret, or rather loft—for it was lighted
      only by a single window to the north, and seemed to have been intended as
      a store-room.
    &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
      The piazzas of the main building and western wing had no floors, as is
      usual; but at the doors and at each window, large, flat irregular slabs of
      granite lay imbedded in the delicious turf, affording comfortable footing
      in all weather. Excellent paths of the same material—not nicely
      adapted, but with the velvety sod filling frequent intervals between the
      stones, led hither and thither from the house, to a crystal spring about
      five paces off, to the road, or to one or two out-houses that lay to the
      north, beyond the brook, and were thoroughly concealed by a few locusts
      and catalpas.
    &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
      Not more than six steps from the main door of the cottage stood the dead
      trunk of a fantastic pear-tree, so clothed from head to foot in the
      gorgeous bignonia blossoms that one required no little scrutiny to
      determine what manner of sweet thing it could be. From various arms of
      this tree hung cages of different kinds. In one, a large wicker cylinder
      with a ring at top, revelled a mocking bird; in another an oriole; in a
      third the impudent bobolink—while three or four more delicate
      prisons were loudly vocal with canaries.
    &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
      The pillars of the piazza were enwreathed in jasmine and sweet
      honeysuckle; while from the angle formed by the main structure and its
      west wing, in front, sprang a grape-vine of unexampled luxuriance.
      Scorning all restraint, it had clambered first to the lower roof—then
      to the higher; and along the ridge of this latter it continued to writhe
      on, throwing out tendrils to the right and left, until at length it fairly
      attained the east gable, and fell trailing over the stairs.
    &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
      The whole house, with its wings, was constructed of the old-fashioned
      Dutch shingles—broad, and with unrounded corners. It is a
      peculiarity of this material to give houses built of it the appearance of
      being wider at bottom than at top—after the manner of Egyptian
      architecture; and in the present instance, this exceedingly picturesque
      effect was aided by numerous pots of gorgeous flowers that almost
      encompassed the base of the buildings.
    &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
      The shingles were painted a dull gray; and the happiness with which this
      neutral tint melted into the vivid green of the tulip tree leaves that
      partially overshadowed the cottage, can readily be conceived by an artist.
    &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
      From the position near the stone wall, as described, the buildings were
      seen at great advantage—for the southeastern angle was thrown
      forward—so that the eye took in at once the whole of the two fronts,
      with the picturesque eastern gable, and at the same time obtained just a
      sufficient glimpse of the northern wing, with parts of a pretty roof to
      the spring-house, and nearly half of a light bridge that spanned the brook
      in the near vicinity of the main buildings.
    &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
      I did not remain very long on the brow of the hill, although long enough
      to make a thorough survey of the scene at my feet. It was clear that I had
      wandered from the road to the village, and I had thus good traveller’s
      excuse to open the gate before me, and inquire my way, at all events; so,
      without more ado, I proceeded.
    &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
      The road, after passing the gate, seemed to lie upon a natural ledge,
      sloping gradually down along the face of the north-eastern cliffs. It led
      me on to the foot of the northern precipice, and thence over the bridge,
      round by the eastern gable to the front door. In this progress, I took
      notice that no sight of the out-houses could be obtained.
    &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
      As I turned the corner of the gable, the mastiff bounded towards me in
      stern silence, but with the eye and the whole air of a tiger. I held him
      out my hand, however, in token of amity—and I never yet knew the dog
      who was proof against such an appeal to his courtesy. He not only shut his
      mouth and wagged his tail, but absolutely offered me his paw—afterward
      extending his civilities to Ponto.
    &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
      As no bell was discernible, I rapped with my stick against the door, which
      stood half open. Instantly a figure advanced to the threshold—that
      of a young woman about twenty-eight years of age—slender, or rather
      slight, and somewhat above the medium height. As she approached, with a
      certain modest decision of step altogether indescribable. I said to
      myself, “Surely here I have found the perfection of natural, in
      contradistinction from artificial grace.” The second impression which she
      made on me, but by far the more vivid of the two, was that of enthusiasm.
      So intense an expression of romance, perhaps I should call it, or of
      unworldliness, as that which gleamed from her deep-set eyes, had never so
      sunk into my heart of hearts before. I know not how it is, but this
      peculiar expression of the eye, wreathing itself occasionally into the
      lips, is the most powerful, if not absolutely the sole spell, which rivets
      my interest in woman. “Romance,” provided my readers fully comprehended
      what I would here imply by the word—“romance” and “womanliness” seem
      to me convertible terms: and, after all, what man truly loves in woman, is
      simply her womanhood. The eyes of Annie (I heard some one from the
      interior call her “Annie, darling!”) were “spiritual grey;” her hair, a
      light chestnut: this is all I had time to observe of her.
    &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
      At her most courteous of invitations, I entered—passing first into a
      tolerably wide vestibule. Having come mainly to observe, I took notice
      that to my right as I stepped in, was a window, such as those in front of
      the house; to the left, a door leading into the principal room; while,
      opposite me, an open door enabled me to see a small apartment, just the
      size of the vestibule, arranged as a study, and having a large bow window
      looking out to the north.
    &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
      Passing into the parlor, I found myself with Mr. Landor—for this, I
      afterwards found, was his name. He was civil, even cordial in his manner,
      but just then, I was more intent on observing the arrangements of the
      dwelling which had so much interested me, than the personal appearance of
      the tenant.
    &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
      The north wing, I now saw, was a bed-chamber, its door opened into the
      parlor. West of this door was a single window, looking toward the brook.
      At the west end of the parlor, were a fireplace, and a door leading into
      the west wing—probably a kitchen.
    &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
      Nothing could be more rigorously simple than the furniture of the parlor.
      On the floor was an ingrain carpet, of excellent texture—a white
      ground, spotted with small circular green figures. At the windows were
      curtains of snowy white jaconet muslin: they were tolerably full, and hung
      decisively, perhaps rather formally in sharp, parallel plaits to the floor—just
      to the floor. The walls were prepared with a French paper of great
      delicacy, a silver ground, with a faint green cord running zig-zag
      throughout. Its expanse was relieved merely by three of Julien’s exquisite
      lithographs a trois crayons, fastened to the wall without frames. One of
      these drawings was a scene of Oriental luxury, or rather voluptuousness;
      another was a “carnival piece,” spirited beyond compare; the third was a
      Greek female head—a face so divinely beautiful, and yet of an
      expression so provokingly indeterminate, never before arrested my
      attention.
    &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
      The more substantial furniture consisted of a round table, a few chairs
      (including a large rocking-chair), and a sofa, or rather “settee;” its
      material was plain maple painted a creamy white, slightly interstriped
      with green; the seat of cane. The chairs and table were “to match,” but
      the forms of all had evidently been designed by the same brain which
      planned “the grounds;” it is impossible to conceive anything more
      graceful.
    &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
      On the table were a few books; a large, square, crystal bottle of some
      novel perfume; a plain ground glass &lt;i&gt;astral&lt;/i&gt; (not solar) lamp with an
      Italian shade; and a large vase of resplendently-blooming flowers.
      Flowers, indeed, of gorgeous colours and delicate odour formed the sole
      mere decoration of the apartment. The fire-place was nearly filled with a
      vase of brilliant geranium. On a triangular shelf in each angle of the
      room stood also a similar vase, varied only as to its lovely contents. One
      or two smaller bouquets adorned the mantel, and late violets clustered
      about the open windows.
    &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
      It is not the purpose of this work to do more than give in detail, a
      picture of Mr. Landor’s residence—as I found it. How he made it what
      it was—and why—with some particulars of Mr. Landor himself—may,
      possibly form the subject of another article.

&lt;p class=&#34;letter&#34;&gt;
    What say of it? what say of &lt;small&gt;CONSCIENCE&lt;/small&gt; grim,&lt;br/&gt;
    That spectre in my path?&lt;br/&gt;
                    —&lt;i&gt;Chamberlayne’s Pharronida.&lt;/i&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
      Let me call myself, for the present, William Wilson. The fair page now
      lying before me need not be sullied with my real appellation. This has
      been already too much an object for the scorn—for the horror—for
      the detestation of my race. To the uttermost regions of the globe have not
      the indignant winds bruited its unparalleled infamy? Oh, outcast of all
      outcasts most abandoned!—to the earth art thou not forever dead? to
      its honors, to its flowers, to its golden aspirations?—and a cloud,
      dense, dismal, and limitless, does it not hang eternally between thy hopes
      and heaven?
    &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
      I would not, if I could, here or to-day, embody a record of my later years
      of unspeakable misery, and unpardonable crime. This epoch—these
      later years—took unto themselves a sudden elevation in turpitude,
      whose origin alone it is my present purpose to assign. Men usually grow
      base by degrees. From me, in an instant, all virtue dropped bodily as a
      mantle. From comparatively trivial wickedness I passed, with the stride of
      a giant, into more than the enormities of an Elah-Gabalus. What chance—what
      one event brought this evil thing to pass, bear with me while I relate.
      Death approaches; and the shadow which foreruns him has thrown a softening
      influence over my spirit. I long, in passing through the dim valley, for
      the sympathy—I had nearly said for the pity—of my fellow men.
      I would fain have them believe that I have been, in some measure, the
      slave of circumstances beyond human control. I would wish them to seek out
      for me, in the details I am about to give, some little oasis of fatality
      amid a wilderness of error. I would have them allow—what they cannot
      refrain from allowing—that, although temptation may have erewhile
      existed as great, man was never thus, at least, tempted before—certainly,
      never thus fell. And is it therefore that he has never thus suffered? Have
      I not indeed been living in a dream? And am I not now dying a victim to
      the horror and the mystery of the wildest of all sublunary visions?
    &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
      I am the descendant of a race whose imaginative and easily excitable
      temperament has at all times rendered them remarkable; and, in my earliest
      infancy, I gave evidence of having fully inherited the family character.
      As I advanced in years it was more strongly developed; becoming, for many
      reasons, a cause of serious disquietude to my friends, and of positive
      injury to myself. I grew self-willed, addicted to the wildest caprices,
      and a prey to the most ungovernable passions. Weak-minded, and beset with
      constitutional infirmities akin to my own, my parents could do but little
      to check the evil propensities which distinguished me. Some feeble and
      ill-directed efforts resulted in complete failure on their part, and, of
      course, in total triumph on mine. Thenceforward my voice was a household
      law; and at an age when few children have abandoned their leading-strings,
      I was left to the guidance of my own will, and became, in all but name,
      the master of my own actions.
    &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
      My earliest recollections of a school-life, are connected with a large,
      rambling, Elizabethan house, in a misty-looking village of England, where
      were a vast number of gigantic and gnarled trees, and where all the houses
      were excessively ancient. In truth, it was a dream-like and
      spirit-soothing place, that venerable old town. At this moment, in fancy,
      I feel the refreshing chilliness of its deeply-shadowed avenues, inhale
      the fragrance of its thousand shrubberies, and thrill anew with
      undefinable delight, at the deep hollow note of the church-bell, breaking,
      each hour, with sullen and sudden roar, upon the stillness of the dusky
      atmosphere in which the fretted Gothic steeple lay imbedded and asleep.
    &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
      It gives me, perhaps, as much of pleasure as I can now in any manner
      experience, to dwell upon minute recollections of the school and its
      concerns. Steeped in misery as I am—misery, alas! only too real—I
      shall be pardoned for seeking relief, however slight and temporary, in the
      weakness of a few rambling details. These, moreover, utterly trivial, and
      even ridiculous in themselves, assume, to my fancy, adventitious
      importance, as connected with a period and a locality when and where I
      recognise the first ambiguous monitions of the destiny which afterwards so
      fully overshadowed me. Let me then remember.
    &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
      The house, I have said, was old and irregular. The grounds were extensive,
      and a high and solid brick wall, topped with a bed of mortar and broken
      glass, encompassed the whole. This prison-like rampart formed the limit of
      our domain; beyond it we saw but thrice a week—once every Saturday
      afternoon, when, attended by two ushers, we were permitted to take brief
      walks in a body through some of the neighbouring fields—and twice
      during Sunday, when we were paraded in the same formal manner to the
      morning and evening service in the one church of the village. Of this
      church the principal of our school was pastor. With how deep a spirit of
      wonder and perplexity was I wont to regard him from our remote pew in the
      gallery, as, with step solemn and slow, he ascended the pulpit! This
      reverend man, with countenance so demurely benign, with robes so glossy
      and so clerically flowing, with wig so minutely powdered, so rigid and so
      vast,—-could this be he who, of late, with sour visage, and in
      snuffy habiliments, administered, ferule in hand, the Draconian laws of
      the academy? Oh, gigantic paradox, too utterly monstrous for solution!
    &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
      At an angle of the ponderous wall frowned a more ponderous gate. It was
      riveted and studded with iron bolts, and surmounted with jagged iron
      spikes. What impressions of deep awe did it inspire! It was never opened
      save for the three periodical egressions and ingressions already
      mentioned; then, in every creak of its mighty hinges, we found a plenitude
      of mystery—a world of matter for solemn remark, or for more solemn
      meditation.
    &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
      The extensive enclosure was irregular in form, having many capacious
      recesses. Of these, three or four of the largest constituted the
      play-ground. It was level, and covered with fine hard gravel. I well
      remember it had no trees, nor benches, nor anything similar within it. Of
      course it was in the rear of the house. In front lay a small parterre,
      planted with box and other shrubs, but through this sacred division we
      passed only upon rare occasions indeed—such as a first advent to
      school or final departure thence, or perhaps, when a parent or friend
      having called for us, we joyfully took our way home for the Christmas or
      Midsummer holidays.
    &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
      But the house!—how quaint an old building was this!—to me how
      veritably a palace of enchantment! There was really no end to its windings—to
      its incomprehensible subdivisions. It was difficult, at any given time, to
      say with certainty upon which of its two stories one happened to be. From
      each room to every other there were sure to be found three or four steps
      either in ascent or descent. Then the lateral branches were innumerable—inconceivable—and
      so returning in upon themselves, that our most exact ideas in regard to
      the whole mansion were not very far different from those with which we
      pondered upon infinity. During the five years of my residence here, I was
      never able to ascertain with precision, in what remote locality lay the
      little sleeping apartment assigned to myself and some eighteen or twenty
      other scholars.
    &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
      The school-room was the largest in the house—I could not help
      thinking, in the world. It was very long, narrow, and dismally low, with
      pointed Gothic windows and a ceiling of oak. In a remote and
      terror-inspiring angle was a square enclosure of eight or ten feet,
      comprising the sanctum, “during hours,” of our principal, the Reverend Dr.
      Bransby. It was a solid structure, with massy door, sooner than open which
      in the absence of the “Dominie,” we would all have willingly perished by
      the &lt;i&gt;peine forte et dure&lt;/i&gt;. In other angles were two other similar boxes, far
      less reverenced, indeed, but still greatly matters of awe. One of these
      was the pulpit of the “classical” usher, one of the “English and
      mathematical.” Interspersed about the room, crossing and recrossing in
      endless irregularity, were innumerable benches and desks, black, ancient,
      and time-worn, piled desperately with much-bethumbed books, and so
      beseamed with initial letters, names at full length, grotesque figures,
      and other multiplied efforts of the knife, as to have entirely lost what
      little of original form might have been their portion in days long
      departed. A huge bucket with water stood at one extremity of the room, and
      a clock of stupendous dimensions at the other.
    &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
      Encompassed by the massy walls of this venerable academy, I passed, yet
      not in tedium or disgust, the years of the third lustrum of my life. The
      teeming brain of childhood requires no external world of incident to
      occupy or amuse it; and the apparently dismal monotony of a school was
      replete with more intense excitement than my riper youth has derived from
      luxury, or my full manhood from crime. Yet I must believe that my first
      mental development had in it much of the uncommon—even much of the
      &lt;i&gt;outré&lt;/i&gt;. Upon mankind at large the events of very early existence rarely
      leave in mature age any definite impression. All is gray shadow—a
      weak and irregular remembrance—an indistinct regathering of feeble
      pleasures and phantasmagoric pains. With me this is not so. In childhood I
      must have felt with the energy of a man what I now find stamped upon
      memory in lines as vivid, as deep, and as durable as the &lt;i&gt;exergues&lt;/i&gt; of the
      Carthaginian medals.
    &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
      Yet in fact—in the fact of the world’s view—how little was
      there to remember! The morning’s awakening, the nightly summons to bed;
      the connings, the recitations; the periodical half-holidays, and
      perambulations; the play-ground, with its broils, its pastimes, its
      intrigues;—these, by a mental sorcery long forgotten, were made to
      involve a wilderness of sensation, a world of rich incident, an universe
      of varied emotion, of excitement the most passionate and spirit-stirring.
      “&lt;i&gt;Oh, le bon temps, que ce siècle de fer!&lt;/i&gt;”
     &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
      In truth, the ardor, the enthusiasm, and the imperiousness of my
      disposition, soon rendered me a marked character among my schoolmates, and
      by slow, but natural gradations, gave me an ascendancy over all not
      greatly older than myself;—over all with a single exception. This
      exception was found in the person of a scholar, who, although no relation,
      bore the same Christian and surname as myself;—a circumstance, in
      fact, little remarkable; for, notwithstanding a noble descent, mine was
      one of those everyday appellations which seem, by prescriptive right, to
      have been, time out of mind, the common property of the mob. In this
      narrative I have therefore designated myself as William Wilson,—a
      fictitious title not very dissimilar to the real. My namesake alone, of
      those who in school phraseology constituted “our set,” presumed to compete
      with me in the studies of the class—in the sports and broils of the
      play-ground—to refuse implicit belief in my assertions, and
      submission to my will—indeed, to interfere with my arbitrary
      dictation in any respect whatsoever. If there is on earth a supreme and
      unqualified despotism, it is the despotism of a master-mind in boyhood
      over the less energetic spirits of its companions.
    &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
      Wilson’s rebellion was to me a source of the greatest embarrassment; the
      more so as, in spite of the bravado with which in public I made a point of
      treating him and his pretensions, I secretly felt that I feared him, and
      could not help thinking the equality which he maintained so easily with
      myself, a proof of his true superiority; since not to be overcome cost me
      a perpetual struggle. Yet this superiority—even this equality—was
      in truth acknowledged by no one but myself; our associates, by some
      unaccountable blindness, seemed not even to suspect it. Indeed, his
      competition, his resistance, and especially his impertinent and dogged
      interference with my purposes, were not more pointed than private. He
      appeared to be destitute alike of the ambition which urged, and of the
      passionate energy of mind which enabled me to excel. In his rivalry he
      might have been supposed actuated solely by a whimsical desire to thwart,
      astonish, or mortify myself; although there were times when I could not
      help observing, with a feeling made up of wonder, abasement, and pique,
      that he mingled with his injuries, his insults, or his contradictions, a
      certain most inappropriate, and assuredly most unwelcome affectionateness
      of manner. I could only conceive this singular behavior to arise from a
      consummate self-conceit assuming the vulgar airs of patronage and
      protection.
    &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
      Perhaps it was this latter trait in Wilson’s conduct, conjoined with our
      identity of name, and the mere accident of our having entered the school
      upon the same day, which set afloat the notion that we were brothers,
      among the senior classes in the academy. These do not usually inquire with
      much strictness into the affairs of their juniors. I have before said, or
      should have said, that Wilson was not, in the most remote degree,
      connected with my family. But assuredly if we had been brothers we must
      have been twins; for, after leaving Dr. Bransby’s, I casually learned that
      my namesake was born on the nineteenth of January, 1813—and this is
      a somewhat remarkable coincidence; for the day is precisely that of my own
      nativity.
    &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
      It may seem strange that in spite of the continual anxiety occasioned me
      by the rivalry of Wilson, and his intolerable spirit of contradiction, I
      could not bring myself to hate him altogether. We had, to be sure, nearly
      every day a quarrel in which, yielding me publicly the palm of victory,
      he, in some manner, contrived to make me feel that it was he who had
      deserved it; yet a sense of pride on my part, and a veritable dignity on
      his own, kept us always upon what are called “speaking terms,” while there
      were many points of strong congeniality in our tempers, operating to awake
      me in a sentiment which our position alone, perhaps, prevented from
      ripening into friendship. It is difficult, indeed, to define, or even to
      describe, my real feelings towards him. They formed a motley and
      heterogeneous admixture;—some petulant animosity, which was not yet
      hatred, some esteem, more respect, much fear, with a world of uneasy
      curiosity. To the moralist it will be unnecessary to say, in addition,
      that Wilson and myself were the most inseparable of companions.
    &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
      It was no doubt the anomalous state of affairs existing between us, which
      turned all my attacks upon him, (and they were many, either open or
      covert) into the channel of banter or practical joke (giving pain while
      assuming the aspect of mere fun) rather than into a more serious and
      determined hostility. But my endeavours on this head were by no means
      uniformly successful, even when my plans were the most wittily concocted;
      for my namesake had much about him, in character, of that unassuming and
      quiet austerity which, while enjoying the poignancy of its own jokes, has
      no heel of Achilles in itself, and absolutely refuses to be laughed at. I
      could find, indeed, but one vulnerable point, and that, lying in a
      personal peculiarity, arising, perhaps, from constitutional disease, would
      have been spared by any antagonist less at his wit’s end than myself;—my
      rival had a weakness in the faucal or guttural organs, which precluded him
      from raising his voice at any time above a very low whisper. Of this
      defect I did not fail to take what poor advantage lay in my power.
    &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
      Wilson’s retaliations in kind were many; and there was one form of his
      practical wit that disturbed me beyond measure. How his sagacity first
      discovered at all that so petty a thing would vex me, is a question I
      never could solve; but, having discovered, he habitually practised the
      annoyance. I had always felt aversion to my uncourtly patronymic, and its
      very common, if not plebeian praenomen. The words were venom in my ears;
      and when, upon the day of my arrival, a second William Wilson came also to
      the academy, I felt angry with him for bearing the name, and doubly
      disgusted with the name because a stranger bore it, who would be the cause
      of its twofold repetition, who would be constantly in my presence, and
      whose concerns, in the ordinary routine of the school business, must
      inevitably, on account of the detestable coincidence, be often confounded
      with my own.
    &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
      The feeling of vexation thus engendered grew stronger with every
      circumstance tending to show resemblance, moral or physical, between my
      rival and myself. I had not then discovered the remarkable fact that we
      were of the same age; but I saw that we were of the same height, and I
      perceived that we were even singularly alike in general contour of person
      and outline of feature. I was galled, too, by the rumor touching a
      relationship, which had grown current in the upper forms. In a word,
      nothing could more seriously disturb me, (although I scrupulously
      concealed such disturbance,) than any allusion to a similarity of mind,
      person, or condition existing between us. But, in truth, I had no reason
      to believe that (with the exception of the matter of relationship, and in
      the case of Wilson himself,) this similarity had ever been made a subject
      of comment, or even observed at all by our schoolfellows. That he observed
      it in all its bearings, and as fixedly as I, was apparent; but that he
      could discover in such circumstances so fruitful a field of annoyance, can
      only be attributed, as I said before, to his more than ordinary
      penetration.
    &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
      His cue, which was to perfect an imitation of myself, lay both in words
      and in actions; and most admirably did he play his part. My dress it was
      an easy matter to copy; my gait and general manner were, without
      difficulty, appropriated; in spite of his constitutional defect, even my
      voice did not escape him. My louder tones were, of course, unattempted,
      but then the key—it was identical; &lt;i&gt;and his singular whisper, it grew the
      very echo of my own&lt;/i&gt;.
    &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
      How greatly this most exquisite portraiture harassed me, (for it could not
      justly be termed a caricature,) I will not now venture to describe. I had
      but one consolation—in the fact that the imitation, apparently, was
      noticed by myself alone, and that I had to endure only the knowing and
      strangely sarcastic smiles of my namesake himself. Satisfied with having
      produced in my bosom the intended effect, he seemed to chuckle in secret
      over the sting he had inflicted, and was characteristically disregardful
      of the public applause which the success of his witty endeavours might
      have so easily elicited. That the school, indeed, did not feel his design,
      perceive its accomplishment, and participate in his sneer, was, for many
      anxious months, a riddle I could not resolve. Perhaps the gradation of his
      copy rendered it not so readily perceptible; or, more possibly, I owed my
      security to the master air of the copyist, who, disdaining the letter,
      (which in a painting is all the obtuse can see,) gave but the full spirit
      of his original for my individual contemplation and chagrin.
    &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
      I have already more than once spoken of the disgusting air of patronage
      which he assumed toward me, and of his frequent officious interference
      with my will. This interference often took the ungracious character of
      advice; advice not openly given, but hinted or insinuated. I received it
      with a repugnance which gained strength as I grew in years. Yet, at this
      distant day, let me do him the simple justice to acknowledge that I can
      recall no occasion when the suggestions of my rival were on the side of
      those errors or follies so usual to his immature age and seeming
      inexperience; that his moral sense, at least, if not his general talents
      and worldly wisdom, was far keener than my own; and that I might, to-day,
      have been a better, and thus a happier man, had I less frequently rejected
      the counsels embodied in those meaning whispers which I then but too
      cordially hated and too bitterly despised.
    &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
      As it was, I at length grew restive in the extreme under his distasteful
      supervision, and daily resented more and more openly what I considered his
      intolerable arrogance. I have said that, in the first years of our
      connexion as schoolmates, my feelings in regard to him might have been
      easily ripened into friendship; but, in the latter months of my residence
      at the academy, although the intrusion of his ordinary manner had, beyond
      doubt, in some measure, abated, my sentiments, in nearly similar
      proportion, partook very much of positive hatred. Upon one occasion he saw
      this, I think, and afterwards avoided, or made a show of avoiding me.
    &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
      It was about the same period, if I remember aright, that, in an
      altercation of violence with him, in which he was more than usually thrown
      off his guard, and spoke and acted with an openness of demeanor rather
      foreign to his nature, I discovered, or fancied I discovered, in his
      accent, his air, and general appearance, a something which first startled,
      and then deeply interested me, by bringing to mind dim visions of my
      earliest infancy—wild, confused and thronging memories of a time
      when memory herself was yet unborn. I cannot better describe the sensation
      which oppressed me than by saying that I could with difficulty shake off
      the belief of my having been acquainted with the being who stood before
      me, at some epoch very long ago—some point of the past even
      infinitely remote. The delusion, however, faded rapidly as it came; and I
      mention it at all but to define the day of the last conversation I there
      held with my singular namesake.
    &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
      The huge old house, with its countless subdivisions, had several large
      chambers communicating with each other, where slept the greater number of
      the students. There were, however, (as must necessarily happen in a
      building so awkwardly planned,) many little nooks or recesses, the odds
      and ends of the structure; and these the economic ingenuity of Dr. Bransby
      had also fitted up as dormitories; although, being the merest closets,
      they were capable of accommodating but a single individual. One of these
      small apartments was occupied by Wilson.
    &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
      One night, about the close of my fifth year at the school, and immediately
      after the altercation just mentioned, finding every one wrapped in sleep,
      I arose from bed, and, lamp in hand, stole through a wilderness of narrow
      passages from my own bedroom to that of my rival. I had long been plotting
      one of those ill-natured pieces of practical wit at his expense in which I
      had hitherto been so uniformly unsuccessful. It was my intention, now, to
      put my scheme in operation, and I resolved to make him feel the whole
      extent of the malice with which I was imbued. Having reached his closet, I
      noiselessly entered, leaving the lamp, with a shade over it, on the
      outside. I advanced a step, and listened to the sound of his tranquil
      breathing. Assured of his being asleep, I returned, took the light, and
      with it again approached the bed. Close curtains were around it, which, in
      the prosecution of my plan, I slowly and quietly withdrew, when the bright
      rays fell vividly upon the sleeper, and my eyes, at the same moment, upon
      his countenance. I looked;—and a numbness, an iciness of feeling
      instantly pervaded my frame. My breast heaved, my knees tottered, my whole
      spirit became possessed with an objectless yet intolerable horror. Gasping
      for breath, I lowered the lamp in still nearer proximity to the face. Were
      these—these the lineaments of William Wilson? I saw, indeed, that
      they were his, but I shook as if with a fit of the ague in fancying they
      were not. What was there about them to confound me in this manner? I
      gazed;—while my brain reeled with a multitude of incoherent
      thoughts. Not thus he appeared—assuredly not thus—in the
      vivacity of his waking hours. The same name! the same contour of person!
      the same day of arrival at the academy! And then his dogged and
      meaningless imitation of my gait, my voice, my habits, and my manner! Was
      it, in truth, within the bounds of human possibility, that what I now saw
      was the result, merely, of the habitual practice of this sarcastic
      imitation? Awe-stricken, and with a creeping shudder, I extinguished the
      lamp, passed silently from the chamber, and left, at once, the halls of
      that old academy, never to enter them again.
    &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
      After a lapse of some months, spent at home in mere idleness, I found
      myself a student at Eton. The brief interval had been sufficient to
      enfeeble my remembrance of the events at Dr. Bransby’s, or at least to
      effect a material change in the nature of the feelings with which I
      remembered them. The truth—the tragedy—of the drama was no
      more. I could now find room to doubt the evidence of my senses; and seldom
      called up the subject at all but with wonder at extent of human credulity,
      and a smile at the vivid force of the imagination which I hereditarily
      possessed. Neither was this species of scepticism likely to be diminished
      by the character of the life I led at Eton. The vortex of thoughtless
      folly into which I there so immediately and so recklessly plunged, washed
      away all but the froth of my past hours, engulfed at once every solid or
      serious impression, and left to memory only the veriest levities of a
      former existence.
    &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
      I do not wish, however, to trace the course of my miserable profligacy
      here—a profligacy which set at defiance the laws, while it eluded
      the vigilance of the institution. Three years of folly, passed without
      profit, had but given me rooted habits of vice, and added, in a somewhat
      unusual degree, to my bodily stature, when, after a week of soulless
      dissipation, I invited a small party of the most dissolute students to a
      secret carousal in my chambers. We met at a late hour of the night; for
      our debaucheries were to be faithfully protracted until morning. The wine
      flowed freely, and there were not wanting other and perhaps more dangerous
      seductions; so that the gray dawn had already faintly appeared in the
      east, while our delirious extravagance was at its height. Madly flushed
      with cards and intoxication, I was in the act of insisting upon a toast of
      more than wonted profanity, when my attention was suddenly diverted by the
      violent, although partial unclosing of the door of the apartment, and by
      the eager voice of a servant from without. He said that some person,
      apparently in great haste, demanded to speak with me in the hall.
    &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
      Wildly excited with wine, the unexpected interruption rather delighted
      than surprised me. I staggered forward at once, and a few steps brought me
      to the vestibule of the building. In this low and small room there hung no
      lamp; and now no light at all was admitted, save that of the exceedingly
      feeble dawn which made its way through the semi-circular window. As I put
      my foot over the threshold, I became aware of the figure of a youth about
      my own height, and habited in a white kerseymere morning frock, cut in the
      novel fashion of the one I myself wore at the moment. This the faint light
      enabled me to perceive; but the features of his face I could not
      distinguish. Upon my entering he strode hurriedly up to me, and, seizing
      me by the arm with a gesture of petulant impatience, whispered the words
      “William Wilson!” in my ear.
    &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
      I grew perfectly sober in an instant.
    &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
      There was that in the manner of the stranger, and in the tremulous shake
      of his uplifted finger, as he held it between my eyes and the light,
      which filled me with unqualified amazement; but it was not this which had
      so violently moved me. It was the pregnancy of solemn admonition in the
      singular, low, hissing utterance; and, above all, it was the character,
      the tone, the key, of those few, simple, and familiar, yet whispered
      syllables, which came with a thousand thronging memories of bygone days,
      and struck upon my soul with the shock of a galvanic battery. Ere I could
      recover the use of my senses he was gone.
    &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
      Although this event failed not of a vivid effect upon my disordered
      imagination, yet was it evanescent as vivid. For some weeks, indeed, I
      busied myself in earnest inquiry, or was wrapped in a cloud of morbid
      speculation. I did not pretend to disguise from my perception the identity
      of the singular individual who thus perseveringly interfered with my
      affairs, and harassed me with his insinuated counsel. But who and what was
      this Wilson?—and whence came he?—and what were his purposes?
      Upon neither of these points could I be satisfied; merely ascertaining, in
      regard to him, that a sudden accident in his family had caused his removal
      from Dr. Bransby’s academy on the afternoon of the day in which I myself
      had eloped. But in a brief period I ceased to think upon the subject; my
      attention being all absorbed in a contemplated departure for Oxford.
      Thither I soon went; the uncalculating vanity of my parents furnishing me
      with an outfit and annual establishment, which would enable me to indulge
      at will in the luxury already so dear to my heart,—to vie in
      profuseness of expenditure with the haughtiest heirs of the wealthiest
      earldoms in Great Britain.
    &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
      Excited by such appliances to vice, my constitutional temperament broke
      forth with redoubled ardor, and I spurned even the common restraints of
      decency in the mad infatuation of my revels. But it were absurd to pause
      in the detail of my extravagance. Let it suffice, that among spendthrifts
      I out-Heroded Herod, and that, giving name to a multitude of novel
      follies, I added no brief appendix to the long catalogue of vices then
      usual in the most dissolute university of Europe.
    &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
      It could hardly be credited, however, that I had, even here, so utterly
      fallen from the gentlemanly estate, as to seek acquaintance with the
      vilest arts of the gambler by profession, and, having become an adept in
      his despicable science, to practise it habitually as a means of increasing
      my already enormous income at the expense of the weak-minded among my
      fellow-collegians. Such, nevertheless, was the fact. And the very enormity
      of this offence against all manly and honourable sentiment proved, beyond
      doubt, the main if not the sole reason of the impunity with which it was
      committed. Who, indeed, among my most abandoned associates, would not
      rather have disputed the clearest evidence of his senses, than have
      suspected of such courses, the gay, the frank, the generous William Wilson—the
      noblest and most liberal commoner at Oxford—him whose follies (said
      his parasites) were but the follies of youth and unbridled fancy—whose
      errors but inimitable whim—whose darkest vice but a careless and
      dashing extravagance?
    &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
      I had been now two years successfully busied in this way, when there came
      to the university a young parvenu nobleman, Glendinning—rich, said
      report, as Herodes Atticus—his riches, too, as easily acquired. I
      soon found him of weak intellect, and, of course, marked him as a fitting
      subject for my skill. I frequently engaged him in play, and contrived,
      with the gambler’s usual art, to let him win considerable sums, the more
      effectually to entangle him in my snares. At length, my schemes being
      ripe, I met him (with the full intention that this meeting should be final
      and decisive) at the chambers of a fellow-commoner, (Mr. Preston,) equally
      intimate with both, but who, to do him justice, entertained not even a
      remote suspicion of my design. To give to this a better coloring, I had
      contrived to have assembled a party of some eight or ten, and was
      solicitously careful that the introduction of cards should appear
      accidental, and originate in the proposal of my contemplated dupe himself.
      To be brief upon a vile topic, none of the low finesse was omitted, so
      customary upon similar occasions that it is a just matter for wonder how
      any are still found so besotted as to fall its victim.
    &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
      We had protracted our sitting far into the night, and I had at length
      effected the manoeuvre of getting Glendinning as my sole antagonist. The
      game, too, was my favorite &lt;i&gt;écarté!&lt;/i&gt; The rest of the company, interested in
      the extent of our play, had abandoned their own cards, and were standing
      around us as spectators. The &lt;i&gt;parvenu&lt;/i&gt;, who had been induced by my artifices
      in the early part of the evening, to drink deeply, now shuffled, dealt, or
      played, with a wild nervousness of manner for which his intoxication, I
      thought, might partially, but could not altogether account. In a very
      short period he had become my debtor to a large amount, when, having taken
      a long draught of port, he did precisely what I had been coolly
      anticipating—he proposed to double our already extravagant stakes.
      With a well-feigned show of reluctance, and not until after my repeated
      refusal had seduced him into some angry words which gave a color of pique
      to my compliance, did I finally comply. The result, of course, did but
      prove how entirely the prey was in my toils: in less than an hour he had
      quadrupled his debt. For some time his countenance had been losing the
      florid tinge lent it by the wine; but now, to my astonishment, I perceived
      that it had grown to a pallor truly fearful. I say to my astonishment.
      Glendinning had been represented to my eager inquiries as immeasurably
      wealthy; and the sums which he had as yet lost, although in themselves
      vast, could not, I supposed, very seriously annoy, much less so violently
      affect him. That he was overcome by the wine just swallowed, was the idea
      which most readily presented itself; and, rather with a view to the
      preservation of my own character in the eyes of my associates, than from
      any less interested motive, I was about to insist, peremptorily, upon a
      discontinuance of the play, when some expressions at my elbow from among
      the company, and an ejaculation evincing utter despair on the part of
      Glendinning, gave me to understand that I had effected his total ruin
      under circumstances which, rendering him an object for the pity of all,
      should have protected him from the ill offices even of a fiend.
    &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
      What now might have been my conduct it is difficult to say. The pitiable
      condition of my dupe had thrown an air of embarrassed gloom over all; and,
      for some moments, a profound silence was maintained, during which I could
      not help feeling my cheeks tingle with the many burning glances of scorn
      or reproach cast upon me by the less abandoned of the party. I will even
      own that an intolerable weight of anxiety was for a brief instant lifted
      from my bosom by the sudden and extraordinary interruption which ensued.
      The wide, heavy folding doors of the apartment were all at once thrown
      open, to their full extent, with a vigorous and rushing impetuosity that
      extinguished, as if by magic, every candle in the room. Their light, in
      dying, enabled us just to perceive that a stranger had entered, about my
      own height, and closely muffled in a cloak. The darkness, however, was now
      total; and we could only feel that he was standing in our midst. Before
      any one of us could recover from the extreme astonishment into which this
      rudeness had thrown all, we heard the voice of the intruder.
    &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
      “Gentlemen,” he said, in a low, distinct, and never-to-be-forgotten
      whisper which thrilled to the very marrow of my bones, “Gentlemen, I make
      no apology for this behaviour, because in thus behaving, I am but
      fulfilling a duty. You are, beyond doubt, uninformed of the true character
      of the person who has to-night won at &lt;i&gt;écarté&lt;/i&gt; a large sum of money from
      Lord Glendinning. I will therefore put you upon an expeditious and
      decisive plan of obtaining this very necessary information. Please to
      examine, at your leisure, the inner linings of the cuff of his left
      sleeve, and the several little packages which may be found in the somewhat
      capacious pockets of his embroidered morning wrapper.”
     &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
      While he spoke, so profound was the stillness that one might have heard a
      pin drop upon the floor. In ceasing, he departed at once, and as abruptly
      as he had entered. Can I—shall I describe my sensations? Must
      I say that I felt all the horrors of the damned? Most assuredly I had
      little time given for reflection. Many hands roughly seized me upon the
      spot, and lights were immediately reprocured. A search ensued. In the
      lining of my sleeve were found all the court cards essential in &lt;i&gt;écarté&lt;/i&gt;,
      and, in the pockets of my wrapper, a number of packs, facsimiles of those
      used at our sittings, with the single exception that mine were of the
      species called, technically, arrondees; the honours being slightly convex
      at the ends, the lower cards slightly convex at the sides. In this
      disposition, the dupe who cuts, as customary, at the length of the pack,
      will invariably find that he cuts his antagonist an honor; while the
      gambler, cutting at the breadth, will, as certainly, cut nothing for his
      victim which may count in the records of the game.
    &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
      Any burst of indignation upon this discovery would have affected me less
      than the silent contempt, or the sarcastic composure, with which it was
      received.
    &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
      “Mr. Wilson,” said our host, stooping to remove from beneath his feet an
      exceedingly luxurious cloak of rare furs, “Mr. Wilson, this is your
      property.” (The weather was cold; and, upon quitting my own room, I had
      thrown a cloak over my dressing wrapper, putting it off upon reaching the
      scene of play.) “I presume it is supererogatory to seek here (eyeing the
      folds of the garment with a bitter smile) for any farther evidence of your
      skill. Indeed, we have had enough. You will see the necessity, I hope, of
      quitting Oxford—at all events, of quitting instantly my chambers.”
     &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
      Abased, humbled to the dust as I then was, it is probable that I should
      have resented this galling language by immediate personal violence, had
      not my whole attention been at the moment arrested by a fact of the most
      startling character. The cloak which I had worn was of a rare description
      of fur; how rare, how extravagantly costly, I shall not venture to say.
      Its fashion, too, was of my own fantastic invention; for I was fastidious
      to an absurd degree of coxcombry, in matters of this frivolous nature.
      When, therefore, Mr. Preston reached me that which he had picked up upon
      the floor, and near the folding doors of the apartment, it was with an
      astonishment nearly bordering upon terror, that I perceived my own already
      hanging on my arm, (where I had no doubt unwittingly placed it,) and that
      the one presented me was but its exact counterpart in every, in even the
      minutest possible particular. The singular being who had so disastrously
      exposed me, had been muffled, I remembered, in a cloak; and none had been
      worn at all by any of the members of our party with the exception of
      myself. Retaining some presence of mind, I took the one offered me by
      Preston; placed it, unnoticed, over my own; left the apartment with a
      resolute scowl of defiance; and, next morning ere dawn of day, commenced a
      hurried journey from Oxford to the continent, in a perfect agony of horror
      and of shame.
    &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
      I fled in vain. My evil destiny pursued me as if in exultation, and
      proved, indeed, that the exercise of its mysterious dominion had as yet
      only begun. Scarcely had I set foot in Paris ere I had fresh evidence of
      the detestable interest taken by this Wilson in my concerns. Years flew,
      while I experienced no relief. Villain!—at Rome, with how untimely,
      yet with how spectral an officiousness, stepped he in between me and my
      ambition! At Vienna, too—at Berlin—and at Moscow! Where, in
      truth, had I not bitter cause to curse him within my heart? From his
      inscrutable tyranny did I at length flee, panic-stricken, as from a
      pestilence; and to the very ends of the earth I fled in vain.
    &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
      And again, and again, in secret communion with my own spirit, would I
      demand the questions “Who is he?—whence came he?—and what are
      his objects?” But no answer was there found. And then I scrutinized, with
      a minute scrutiny, the forms, and the methods, and the leading traits of
      his impertinent supervision. But even here there was very little upon
      which to base a conjecture. It was noticeable, indeed, that, in no one of
      the multiplied instances in which he had of late crossed my path, had he
      so crossed it except to frustrate those schemes, or to disturb those
      actions, which, if fully carried out, might have resulted in bitter
      mischief. Poor justification this, in truth, for an authority so
      imperiously assumed! Poor indemnity for natural rights of self-agency so
      pertinaciously, so insultingly denied!
    &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
      I had also been forced to notice that my tormentor, for a very long period
      of time, (while scrupulously and with miraculous dexterity maintaining his
      whim of an identity of apparel with myself,) had so contrived it, in the
      execution of his varied interference with my will, that I saw not, at any
      moment, the features of his face. Be Wilson what he might, this, at least,
      was but the veriest of affectation, or of folly. Could he, for an instant,
      have supposed that, in my admonisher at Eton—in the destroyer of my
      honor at Oxford,—in him who thwarted my ambition at Rome, my revenge
      at Paris, my passionate love at Naples, or what he falsely termed my
      avarice in Egypt,—that in this, my arch-enemy and evil genius, could
      fail to recognise the William Wilson of my school boy days,—the
      namesake, the companion, the rival,—the hated and dreaded rival at
      Dr. Bransby’s? Impossible!—But let me hasten to the last eventful
      scene of the drama.
    &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
      Thus far I had succumbed supinely to this imperious domination. The
      sentiment of deep awe with which I habitually regarded the elevated
      character, the majestic wisdom, the apparent omnipresence and omnipotence
      of Wilson, added to a feeling of even terror, with which certain other
      traits in his nature and assumptions inspired me, had operated, hitherto,
      to impress me with an idea of my own utter weakness and helplessness, and
      to suggest an implicit, although bitterly reluctant submission to his
      arbitrary will. But, of late days, I had given myself up entirely to wine;
      and its maddening influence upon my hereditary temper rendered me more and
      more impatient of control. I began to murmur,—to hesitate,—to
      resist. And was it only fancy which induced me to believe that, with the
      increase of my own firmness, that of my tormentor underwent a proportional
      diminution? Be this as it may, I now began to feel the inspiration of a
      burning hope, and at length nurtured in my secret thoughts a stern and
      desperate resolution that I would submit no longer to be enslaved.
    &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
      It was at Rome, during the Carnival of 18—, that I attended a
      masquerade in the palazzo of the Neapolitan Duke Di Broglio. I had
      indulged more freely than usual in the excesses of the wine-table; and now
      the suffocating atmosphere of the crowded rooms irritated me beyond
      endurance. The difficulty, too, of forcing my way through the mazes of the
      company contributed not a little to the ruffling of my temper; for I was
      anxiously seeking, (let me not say with what unworthy motive) the young,
      the gay, the beautiful wife of the aged and doting Di Broglio. With a too
      unscrupulous confidence she had previously communicated to me the secret
      of the costume in which she would be habited, and now, having caught a
      glimpse of her person, I was hurrying to make my way into her presence. At
      this moment I felt a light hand placed upon my shoulder, and that
      ever-remembered, low, damnable &lt;i&gt;whisper&lt;/i&gt; within my ear.
    &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
      In an absolute phrenzy of wrath, I turned at once upon him who had thus
      interrupted me, and seized him violently by the collar. He was attired, as
      I had expected, in a costume altogether similar to my own; wearing a
      Spanish cloak of blue velvet, begirt about the waist with a crimson belt
      sustaining a rapier. A mask of black silk entirely covered his face.
    &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
      “Scoundrel!” I said, in a voice husky with rage, while every syllable I
      uttered seemed as new fuel to my fury, “scoundrel! impostor! accursed
      villain! you shall not—you shall not dog me unto death! Follow me,
      or I stab you where you stand!”—and I broke my way from the
      ball-room into a small ante-chamber adjoining, dragging him
      unresistingly with me as I went.
    &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
      Upon entering, I thrust him furiously from me. He staggered against the
      wall, while I closed the door with an oath, and commanded him to draw. He
      hesitated but for an instant; then, with a slight sigh, drew in silence,
      and put himself upon his defence.
    &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
      The contest was brief indeed. I was frantic with every species of wild
      excitement, and felt within my single arm the energy and power of a
      multitude. In a few seconds I forced him by sheer strength against the
      wainscoting, and thus, getting him at mercy, plunged my sword, with brute
      ferocity, repeatedly through and through his bosom.
    &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
      At that instant some person tried the latch of the door. I hastened to
      prevent an intrusion, and then immediately returned to my dying
      antagonist. But what human language can adequately portray that
      astonishment, that horror which possessed me at the spectacle then
      presented to view? The brief moment in which I averted my eyes had been
      sufficient to produce, apparently, a material change in the arrangements
      at the upper or farther end of the room. A large mirror,—so at first
      it seemed to me in my confusion—now stood where none had been
      perceptible before; and, as I stepped up to it in extremity of terror,
      mine own image, but with features all pale and dabbled in blood, advanced
      to meet me with a feeble and tottering gait.
    &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
      Thus it appeared, I say, but was not. It was my antagonist—it was
      Wilson, who then stood before me in the agonies of his dissolution. His
      mask and cloak lay, where he had thrown them, upon the floor. Not a thread
      in all his raiment—not a line in all the marked and singular
      lineaments of his face which was not, even in the most absolute identity,
      mine own!
    &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
      It was Wilson; but he spoke no longer in a whisper, and I could have
      fancied that I myself was speaking while he said:
    &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
&lt;i&gt;“You have conquered, and I yield. Yet, henceforward art thou also dead—dead
      to the World, to Heaven and to Hope! In me didst thou exist—and, in
      my death, see by this image, which is thine own, how utterly thou hast
      murdered thyself.”&lt;/i&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;!--end chapter--&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class=&#34;chapter&#34;&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;&lt;a id=&#34;chap2.20&#34;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;THE TELL-TALE HEART.&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
      True!—nervous—very, very dreadfully nervous I had been and am;
      but why will you say that I am mad? The disease had sharpened my senses—not
      destroyed—not dulled them. Above all was the sense of hearing acute.
      I heard all things in the heaven and in the earth. I heard many things in
      hell. How, then, am I mad? Hearken! and observe how healthily—how
      calmly I can tell you the whole story.
    &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
      It is impossible to say how first the idea entered my brain; but once
      conceived, it haunted me day and night. Object there was none. Passion
      there was none. I loved the old man. He had never wronged me. He had never
      given me insult. For his gold I had no desire. I think it was his eye!
      yes, it was this! He had the eye of a vulture—a pale blue eye, with
      a film over it. Whenever it fell upon me, my blood ran cold; and so by
      degrees—very gradually—I made up my mind to take the life of
      the old man, and thus rid myself of the eye forever.
    &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
      Now this is the point. You fancy me mad. Madmen know nothing. But you
      should have seen me. You should have seen how wisely I proceeded—with
      what caution—with what foresight—with what dissimulation I
      went to work! I was never kinder to the old man than during the whole week
      before I killed him. And every night, about midnight, I turned the latch
      of his door and opened it—oh, so gently! And then, when I had made an
      opening sufficient for my head, I put in a dark lantern, all closed,
      closed, that no light shone out, and then I thrust in my head. Oh, you
      would have laughed to see how cunningly I thrust it in! I moved it slowly—very,
      very slowly, so that I might not disturb the old man’s sleep. It took me
      an hour to place my whole head within the opening so far that I could see
      him as he lay upon his bed. Ha!—would a madman have been so wise as this?
      And then, when my head was well in the room, I undid the lantern
      cautiously—oh, so cautiously—cautiously (for the hinges
      creaked)—I undid it just so much that a single thin ray fell upon
      the vulture eye. And this I did for seven long nights—every night
      just at midnight—but I found the eye always closed; and so it was
      impossible to do the work; for it was not the old man who vexed me, but
      his Evil Eye. And every morning, when the day broke, I went boldly into
      the chamber, and spoke courageously to him, calling him by name in a
      hearty tone, and inquiring how he has passed the night. So you see he
      would have been a very profound old man, indeed, to suspect that every
      night, just at twelve, I looked in upon him while he slept.
    &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
      Upon the eighth night I was more than usually cautious in opening the
      door. A watch’s minute hand moves more quickly than did mine. Never before
      that night had I felt the extent of my own powers—of my sagacity. I
      could scarcely contain my feelings of triumph. To think that there I was,
      opening the door, little by little, and he not even to dream of my secret
      deeds or thoughts. I fairly chuckled at the idea; and perhaps he heard me;
      for he moved on the bed suddenly, as if startled. Now you may think that I
      drew back—but no. His room was as black as pitch with the thick
      darkness, (for the shutters were close fastened, through fear of robbers,)
      and so I knew that he could not see the opening of the door, and I kept
      pushing it on steadily, steadily.
    &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
      I had my head in, and was about to open the lantern, when my thumb slipped
      upon the tin fastening, and the old man sprang up in bed, crying out—“Who’s
      there?”
     &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
      I kept quite still and said nothing. For a whole hour I did not move a
      muscle, and in the meantime I did not hear him lie down. He was still
      sitting up in the bed listening;—just as I have done, night after
      night, hearkening to the death watches in the wall.
    &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
      Presently I heard a slight groan, and I knew it was the groan of mortal
      terror. It was not a groan of pain or of grief—oh, no!—it was
      the low stifled sound that arises from the bottom of the soul when
      overcharged with awe. I knew the sound well. Many a night, just at
      midnight, when all the world slept, it has welled up from my own bosom,
      deepening, with its dreadful echo, the terrors that distracted me. I say I
      knew it well. I knew what the old man felt, and pitied him, although I
      chuckled at heart. I knew that he had been lying awake ever since the
      first slight noise, when he had turned in the bed. His fears had been ever
      since growing upon him. He had been trying to fancy them causeless, but
      could not. He had been saying to himself—“It is nothing but the wind
      in the chimney—it is only a mouse crossing the floor,” or “It is
      merely a cricket which has made a single chirp.” Yes, he had been trying
      to comfort himself with these suppositions: but he had found all in vain.
      All in vain; because Death, in approaching him had stalked with his black
      shadow before him, and enveloped the victim. And it was the mournful
      influence of the unperceived shadow that caused him to feel—although
      he neither saw nor heard—to feel the presence of my head within the
      room.
    &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
      When I had waited a long time, very patiently, without hearing him lie
      down, I resolved to open a little—a very, very little crevice in the
      lantern. So I opened it—you cannot imagine how stealthily,
      stealthily—until, at length a simple dim ray, like the thread of the
      spider, shot from out the crevice and fell full upon the vulture eye.
    &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
      It was open—wide, wide open—and I grew furious as I gazed upon
      it. I saw it with perfect distinctness—all a dull blue, with a
      hideous veil over it that chilled the very marrow in my bones; but I could
      see nothing else of the old man’s face or person: for I had directed the
      ray as if by instinct, precisely upon the damned spot.
    &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
      And have I not told you that what you mistake for madness is but
      over-acuteness of the sense?—now, I say, there came to my ears a
      low, dull, quick sound, such as a watch makes when enveloped in cotton. I
      knew that sound well, too. It was the beating of the old man’s heart. It
      increased my fury, as the beating of a drum stimulates the soldier into
      courage.
    &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
      But even yet I refrained and kept still. I scarcely breathed. I held the
      lantern motionless. I tried how steadily I could maintain the ray upon the
      eve. Meantime the hellish tattoo of the heart increased. It grew quicker
      and quicker, and louder and louder every instant. The old man’s terror
      must have been extreme! It grew louder, I say, louder every moment!—do
      you mark me well? I have told you that I am nervous: so I am. And now at
      the dead hour of the night, amid the dreadful silence of that old house,
      so strange a noise as this excited me to uncontrollable terror. Yet, for
      some minutes longer I refrained and stood still. But the beating grew
      louder, louder! I thought the heart must burst. And now a new anxiety
      seized me—the sound would be heard by a neighbour! The old man’s
      hour had come! With a loud yell, I threw open the lantern and leaped into
      the room. He shrieked once—once only. In an instant I dragged him to
      the floor, and pulled the heavy bed over him. I then smiled gaily, to find
      the deed so far done. But, for many minutes, the heart beat on with a
      muffled sound. This, however, did not vex me; it would not be heard
      through the wall. At length it ceased. The old man was dead. I removed the
      bed and examined the corpse. Yes, he was stone, stone dead. I placed my
      hand upon the heart and held it there many minutes. There was no
      pulsation. He was stone dead. His eye would trouble me no more.
    &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
      If still you think me mad, you will think so no longer when I describe the
      wise precautions I took for the concealment of the body. The night waned,
      and I worked hastily, but in silence. First of all I dismembered the
      corpse. I cut off the head and the arms and the legs.
    &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
      I then took up three planks from the flooring of the chamber, and
      deposited all between the scantlings. I then replaced the boards so
      cleverly, so cunningly, that no human eye—not even his—could
      have detected any thing wrong. There was nothing to wash out—no
      stain of any kind—no blood-spot whatever. I had been too wary for
      that. A tub had caught all—ha! ha!
    &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
      When I had made an end of these labors, it was four o’clock—still
      dark as midnight. As the bell sounded the hour, there came a knocking at
      the street door. I went down to open it with a light heart,—for what
      had I now to fear? There entered three men, who introduced themselves,
      with perfect suavity, as officers of the police. A shriek had been heard
      by a neighbour during the night; suspicion of foul play had been aroused;
      information had been lodged at the police office, and they (the officers)
      had been deputed to search the premises.
    &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
      I smiled,—for what had I to fear? I bade the gentlemen welcome. The
      shriek, I said, was my own in a dream. The old man, I mentioned, was
      absent in the country. I took my visitors all over the house. I bade them
      search—search well. I led them, at length, to his chamber. I showed
      them his treasures, secure, undisturbed. In the enthusiasm of my
      confidence, I brought chairs into the room, and desired them here to rest
      from their fatigues, while I myself, in the wild audacity of my perfect
      triumph, placed my own seat upon the very spot beneath which reposed the
      corpse of the victim.
    &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
      The officers were satisfied. My manner had convinced them. I was
      singularly at ease. They sat, and while I answered cheerily, they chatted
      of familiar things. But, ere long, I felt myself getting pale and wished
      them gone. My head ached, and I fancied a ringing in my ears: but still
      they sat and still chatted. The ringing became more distinct:—it
      continued and became more distinct: I talked more freely to get rid of the
      feeling: but it continued and gained definiteness—until, at length,
      I found that the noise was not within my ears.
    &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
      No doubt I now grew &lt;i&gt;very&lt;/i&gt; pale;—but I talked more fluently,
      and with a heightened voice. Yet the sound increased—and what could
      I do? It was a low, dull, quick sound—much such a sound as a watch
      makes when enveloped in cotton. I gasped for breath—and yet the
      officers heard it not. I talked more quickly—more vehemently; but
      the noise steadily increased. I arose and argued about trifles, in a high
      key and with violent gesticulations; but the noise steadily increased. Why
      would they not be gone? I paced the floor to and fro with heavy strides,
      as if excited to fury by the observations of the men—but the noise
      steadily increased. Oh God! what could I do? I foamed—I raved—I
      swore! I swung the chair upon which I had been sitting, and grated it upon
      the boards, but the noise arose over all and continually increased. It
      grew louder—louder—louder! And still the men chatted
      pleasantly, and smiled. Was it possible they heard not? Almighty God!—no,
      no! They heard!—they suspected!—they knew!—they were
      making a mockery of my horror!—this I thought, and this I think. But
      anything was better than this agony! Anything was more tolerable than this
      derision! I could bear those hypocritical smiles no longer! I felt that I
      must scream or die! and now—again!—hark! louder! louder!
      louder! &lt;i&gt;louder!&lt;/i&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
      “Villains!” I shrieked, “dissemble no more! I admit the deed!—tear
      up the planks!—here, here!—It is the beating of his hideous heart!”
     &lt;/p&gt;

      Misery is manifold. The wretchedness of earth is multiform. Overreaching
      the wide horizon as the rainbow, its hues are as various as the hues of
      that arch—as distinct too, yet as intimately blended. Overreaching
      the wide horizon as the rainbow! How is it that from beauty I have derived
      a type of unloveliness?—from the covenant of peace, a simile of
      sorrow? But as, in ethics, evil is a consequence of good, so, in fact, out
      of joy is sorrow born. Either the memory of past bliss is the anguish of
      to-day, or the agonies which &lt;i&gt;are&lt;/i&gt;, have their origin in the
      ecstasies which &lt;i&gt;might have been&lt;/i&gt;.
    &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
      My baptismal name is Egaeus; that of my family I will not mention. Yet
      there are no towers in the land more time-honored than my gloomy, gray,
      hereditary halls. Our line has been called a race of visionaries; and in
      many striking particulars—in the character of the family mansion—in
      the frescos of the chief saloon—in the tapestries of the dormitories—in
      the chiselling of some buttresses in the armory—but more especially
      in the gallery of antique paintings—in the fashion of the library
      chamber—and, lastly, in the very peculiar nature of the library’s
      contents—there is more than sufficient evidence to warrant the
      belief.
    &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
      The recollections of my earliest years are connected with that chamber,
      and with its volumes—of which latter I will say no more. Here died
      my mother. Herein was I born. But it is mere idleness to say that I had
      not lived before—that the soul has no previous existence. You deny
      it?—let us not argue the matter. Convinced myself, I seek not to
      convince. There is, however, a remembrance of aerial forms—of
      spiritual and meaning eyes—of sounds, musical yet sad—a
      remembrance which will not be excluded; a memory like a shadow—vague,
      variable, indefinite, unsteady; and like a shadow, too, in the
      impossibility of my getting rid of it while the sunlight of my reason
      shall exist.
    &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
      In that chamber was I born. Thus awaking from the long night of what
      seemed, but was not, nonentity, at once into the very regions of fairy
      land—into a palace of imagination—into the wild dominions of
      monastic thought and erudition—it is not singular that I gazed
      around me with a startled and ardent eye—that I loitered away my
      boyhood in books, and dissipated my youth in reverie; but it &lt;i&gt;is&lt;/i&gt;
      singular that as years rolled away, and the noon of manhood found me still
      in the mansion of my fathers—it &lt;i&gt;is&lt;/i&gt; wonderful what stagnation
      there fell upon the springs of my life—wonderful how total an
      inversion took place in the character of my commonest thought. The
      realities of the world affected me as visions, and as visions only, while
      the wild ideas of the land of dreams became, in turn, not the material of
      my every-day existence, but in very deed that existence utterly and solely
      in itself.
    &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;hr/&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
      Berenice and I were cousins, and we grew up together in my paternal halls.
      Yet differently we grew—I, ill of health, and buried in gloom—she,
      agile, graceful, and overflowing with energy; hers, the ramble on the
      hill-side—mine the studies of the cloister; I, living within my own
      heart, and addicted, body and soul, to the most intense and painful
      meditation—she, roaming carelessly through life, with no thought of
      the shadows in her path, or the silent flight of the raven-winged hours.
      Berenice!—I call upon her name—Berenice!—and from the
      gray ruins of memory a thousand tumultuous recollections are startled at
      the sound! Ah, vividly is her image before me now, as in the early days of
      her light-heartedness and joy! Oh, gorgeous yet fantastic beauty! Oh,
      sylph amid the shrubberies of Arnheim! Oh, Naiad among its fountains! And
      then—then all is mystery and terror, and a tale which should not be
      told. Disease—a fatal disease, fell like the simoon upon her frame;
      and, even while I gazed upon her, the spirit of change swept over her,
      pervading her mind, her habits, and her character, and, in a manner the
      most subtle and terrible, disturbing even the identity of her person!
      Alas! the destroyer came and went!—and the victim—where is
      she? I knew her not—or knew her no longer as Berenice.
    &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
      Among the numerous train of maladies superinduced by that fatal and
      primary one which effected a revolution of so horrible a kind in the moral
      and physical being of my cousin, may be mentioned as the most distressing
      and obstinate in its nature, a species of epilepsy not unfrequently
      terminating in &lt;i&gt;trance&lt;/i&gt; itself—trance very nearly resembling
      positive dissolution, and from which her manner of recovery was in most
      instances, startlingly abrupt. In the mean time my own disease—for I
      have been told that I should call it by no other appellation—my own
      disease, then, grew rapidly upon me, and assumed finally a monomaniac
      character of a novel and extraordinary form—hourly and momently
      gaining vigor—and at length obtaining over me the most
      incomprehensible ascendancy. This monomania, if I must so term it,
      consisted in a morbid irritability of those properties of the mind in
      metaphysical science termed the &lt;i&gt;attentive&lt;/i&gt;. It is more than probable
      that I am not understood; but I fear, indeed, that it is in no manner
      possible to convey to the mind of the merely general reader, an adequate
      idea of that nervous &lt;i&gt;intensity of interest&lt;/i&gt; with which, in my case,
      the powers of meditation (not to speak technically) busied and buried
      themselves, in the contemplation of even the most ordinary objects of the
      universe.
    &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
      To muse for long unwearied hours, with my attention riveted to some
      frivolous device on the margin, or in the typography of a book; to become
      absorbed, for the better part of a summer’s day, in a quaint shadow
      falling aslant upon the tapestry or upon the floor; to lose myself, for an
      entire night, in watching the steady flame of a lamp, or the embers of a
      fire; to dream away whole days over the perfume of a flower; to repeat,
      monotonously, some common word, until the sound, by dint of frequent
      repetition, ceased to convey any idea whatever to the mind; to lose all
      sense of motion or physical existence, by means of absolute bodily
      quiescence long and obstinately persevered in: such were a few of the most
      common and least pernicious vagaries induced by a condition of the mental
      faculties, not, indeed, altogether unparalleled, but certainly bidding
      defiance to anything like analysis or explanation.
    &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
      Yet let me not be misapprehended. The undue, earnest, and morbid attention
      thus excited by objects in their own nature frivolous, must not be
      confounded in character with that ruminating propensity common to all
      mankind, and more especially indulged in by persons of ardent imagination.
      It was not even, as might be at first supposed, an extreme condition, or
      exaggeration of such propensity, but primarily and essentially distinct
      and different. In the one instance, the dreamer, or enthusiast, being
      interested by an object usually &lt;i&gt;not&lt;/i&gt; frivolous, imperceptibly loses
      sight of this object in a wilderness of deductions and suggestions issuing
      therefrom, until, at the conclusion of a day-dream &lt;i&gt;often replete with
      luxury&lt;/i&gt;, he finds the &lt;i&gt;incitamentum&lt;/i&gt;, or first cause of his
      musings, entirely vanished and forgotten. In my case, the primary object
      was &lt;i&gt;invariably frivolous&lt;/i&gt;, although assuming, through the medium of
      my distempered vision, a refracted and unreal importance. Few deductions,
      if any, were made; and those few pertinaciously returning in upon the
      original object as a centre. The meditations were &lt;i&gt;never&lt;/i&gt;
      pleasurable; and, at the termination of the reverie, the first cause, so
      far from being out of sight, had attained that supernaturally exaggerated
      interest which was the prevailing feature of the disease. In a word, the
      powers of mind more particularly exercised were, with me, as I have said
      before, the &lt;i&gt;attentive&lt;/i&gt;, and are, with the day-dreamer, the &lt;i&gt;speculative&lt;/i&gt;.
    &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
      My books, at this epoch, if they did not actually serve to irritate the
      disorder, partook, it will be perceived, largely, in their imaginative and
      inconsequential nature, of the characteristic qualities of the disorder
      itself. I well remember, among others, the treatise of the noble Italian,
      Coelius Secundus Curio, “&lt;i&gt;De Amplitudine Beati Regni Dei;&lt;/i&gt;” St.
      Austin’s great work, the “City of God;” and Tertullian’s “&lt;i&gt;De Carne
      Christi&lt;/i&gt;,” in which the paradoxical sentence “&lt;i&gt;Mortuus est Dei
      filius; credible est quia ineptum est: et sepultus resurrexit; certum est
      quia impossibile est,&lt;/i&gt;” occupied my undivided time, for many weeks of
      laborious and fruitless investigation.
    &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
      Thus it will appear that, shaken from its balance only by trivial things,
      my reason bore resemblance to that ocean-crag spoken of by Ptolemy
      Hephestion, which steadily resisting the attacks of human violence, and
      the fiercer fury of the waters and the winds, trembled only to the touch
      of the flower called Asphodel. And although, to a careless thinker, it
      might appear a matter beyond doubt, that the alteration produced by her
      unhappy malady, in the &lt;i&gt;moral&lt;/i&gt; condition of Berenice, would afford me
      many objects for the exercise of that intense and abnormal meditation
      whose nature I have been at some trouble in explaining, yet such was not
      in any degree the case. In the lucid intervals of my infirmity, her
      calamity, indeed, gave me pain, and, taking deeply to heart that total
      wreck of her fair and gentle life, I did not fail to ponder, frequently
      and bitterly, upon the wonder-working means by which so strange a
      revolution had been so suddenly brought to pass. But these reflections
      partook not of the idiosyncrasy of my disease, and were such as would have
      occurred, under similar circumstances, to the ordinary mass of mankind.
      True to its own character, my disorder revelled in the less important but
      more startling changes wrought in the &lt;i&gt;physical&lt;/i&gt; frame of Berenice—in
      the singular and most appalling distortion of her personal identity.
    &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
      During the brightest days of her unparalleled beauty, most surely I had
      never loved her. In the strange anomaly of my existence, feelings with me,
      &lt;i&gt;had never been&lt;/i&gt; of the heart, and my passions &lt;i&gt;always were&lt;/i&gt; of
      the mind. Through the gray of the early morning—among the trellised
      shadows of the forest at noonday—and in the silence of my library at
      night—she had flitted by my eyes, and I had seen her—not as
      the living and breathing Berenice, but as the Berenice of a dream; not as
      a being of the earth, earthy, but as the abstraction of such a being; not
      as a thing to admire, but to analyze; not as an object of love, but as the
      theme of the most abstruse although desultory speculation. And &lt;i&gt;now&lt;/i&gt;—now
      I shuddered in her presence, and grew pale at her approach; yet, bitterly
      lamenting her fallen and desolate condition, I called to mind that she had
      loved me long, and, in an evil moment, I spoke to her of marriage.
    &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
      And at length the period of our nuptials was approaching, when, upon an
      afternoon in the winter of the year—one of those unseasonably warm,
      calm, and misty days which are the nurse of the beautiful Halcyon (*1),—I
      sat, (and sat, as I thought, alone,) in the inner apartment of the
      library. But, uplifting my eyes, I saw that Berenice stood before me.
    &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
      Was it my own excited imagination—or the misty influence of the
      atmosphere—or the uncertain twilight of the chamber—or the
      gray draperies which fell around her figure—that caused in it so
      vacillating and indistinct an outline? I could not tell. She spoke no
      word; and I—not for worlds could I have uttered a syllable. An icy
      chill ran through my frame; a sense of insufferable anxiety oppressed me;
      a consuming curiosity pervaded my soul; and sinking back upon the chair, I
      remained for some time breathless and motionless, with my eyes riveted
      upon her person. Alas! its emaciation was excessive, and not one vestige
      of the former being lurked in any single line of the contour. My burning
      glances at length fell upon the face.
    &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
      The forehead was high, and very pale, and singularly placid; and the once
      jetty hair fell partially over it, and overshadowed the hollow temples
      with innumerable ringlets, now of a vivid yellow, and jarring
      discordantly, in their fantastic character, with the reigning melancholy
      of the countenance. The eyes were lifeless, and lustreless, and seemingly
      pupilless, and I shrank involuntarily from their glassy stare to the
      contemplation of the thin and shrunken lips. They parted; and in a smile
      of peculiar meaning, &lt;i&gt;the teeth&lt;/i&gt; of the changed Berenice disclosed
      themselves slowly to my view. Would to God that I had never beheld them,
      or that, having done so, I had died!
    &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;hr/&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
      The shutting of a door disturbed me, and, looking up, I found that my
      cousin had departed from the chamber. But from the disordered chamber of
      my brain, had not, alas! departed, and would not be driven away, the white
      and ghastly &lt;i&gt;spectrum&lt;/i&gt; of the teeth. Not a speck on their surface—not
      a shade on their enamel—not an indenture in their edges—but
      what that period of her smile had sufficed to brand in upon my memory. I
      saw them &lt;i&gt;now&lt;/i&gt; even more unequivocally than I beheld them &lt;i&gt;then&lt;/i&gt;.
      The teeth!—the teeth!—they were here, and there, and
      everywhere, and visibly and palpably before me; long, narrow, and
      excessively white, with the pale lips writhing about them, as in the very
      moment of their first terrible development. Then came the full fury of my
      &lt;i&gt;monomania&lt;/i&gt;, and I struggled in vain against its strange and
      irresistible influence. In the multiplied objects of the external world I
      had no thoughts but for the teeth. For these I longed with a phrenzied
      desire. All other matters and all different interests became absorbed in
      their single contemplation. They—they alone were present to the
      mental eye, and they, in their sole individuality, became the essence of
      my mental life. I held them in every light. I turned them in every
      attitude. I surveyed their characteristics. I dwelt upon their
      peculiarities. I pondered upon their conformation. I mused upon the
      alteration in their nature. I shuddered as I assigned to them in
      imagination a sensitive and sentient power, and even when unassisted by
      the lips, a capability of moral expression. Of Mademoiselle Salle it has
      been well said, “&lt;i&gt;Que tous ses pas etaient des sentiments&lt;/i&gt;,” and of
      Berenice I more seriously believed &lt;i&gt;que toutes ses dents etaient des
      idées&lt;/i&gt;. &lt;i&gt;Des idées!&lt;/i&gt;—ah here was the idiotic thought that
      destroyed me! &lt;i&gt;Des idées!&lt;/i&gt;—ah, &lt;i&gt;therefore&lt;/i&gt; it was that I
      coveted them so madly! I felt that their possession could alone ever
      restore me to peace, in giving me back to reason.
    &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
      And the evening closed in upon me thus—and then the darkness came,
      and tarried, and went—and the day again dawned—and the mists
      of a second night were now gathering around—and still I sat
      motionless in that solitary room—and still I sat buried in
      meditation—and still the &lt;i&gt;phantasma&lt;/i&gt; of the teeth maintained
      its terrible ascendancy, as, with the most vivid hideous distinctness, it
      floated about amid the changing lights and shadows of the chamber. At
      length there broke in upon my dreams a cry as of horror and dismay; and
      thereunto, after a pause, succeeded the sound of troubled voices,
      intermingled with many low moanings of sorrow or of pain. I arose from my
      seat, and throwing open one of the doors of the library, saw standing out
      in the ante-chamber a servant maiden, all in tears, who told me that
      Berenice was—no more! She had been seized with epilepsy in the early
      morning, and now, at the closing in of the night, the grave was ready for
      its tenant, and all the preparations for the burial were completed.
    &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;hr/&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
      I found myself sitting in the library, and again sitting there alone. It
      seemed that I had newly awakened from a confused and exciting dream. I
      knew that it was now midnight, and I was well aware, that since the
      setting of the sun, Berenice had been interred. But of that dreary period
      which intervened I had no positive, at least no definite comprehension.
      Yet its memory was replete with horror—horror more horrible from
      being vague, and terror more terrible from ambiguity. It was a fearful
      page in the record my existence, written all over with dim, and hideous,
      and unintelligible recollections. I strived to decypher them, but in vain;
      while ever and anon, like the spirit of a departed sound, the shrill and
      piercing shriek of a female voice seemed to be ringing in my ears. I had
      done a deed—what was it? I asked myself the question aloud, and the
      whispering echoes of the chamber answered me,—“&lt;i&gt;What was it?&lt;/i&gt;”
     &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
      On the table beside me burned a lamp, and near it lay a little box. It was
      of no remarkable character, and I had seen it frequently before, for it
      was the property of the family physician; but how came it &lt;i&gt;there&lt;/i&gt;,
      upon my table, and why did I shudder in regarding it? These things were in
      no manner to be accounted for, and my eyes at length dropped to the open
      pages of a book, and to a sentence underscored therein. The words were the
      singular but simple ones of the poet Ebn Zaiat:—“&lt;i&gt;Dicebant mihi
      sodales si sepulchrum amicae visitarem, curas meas aliquantulum fore
      levatas&lt;/i&gt;.” Why then, as I perused them, did the hairs of my head erect
      themselves on end, and the blood of my body become congealed within my
      veins?
    &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
      There came a light tap at the library door—and, pale as the tenant
      of a tomb, a menial entered upon tiptoe. His looks were wild with terror,
      and he spoke to me in a voice tremulous, husky, and very low. What said
      he?—some broken sentences I heard. He told of a wild cry disturbing
      the silence of the night—of the gathering together of the household—of
      a search in the direction of the sound; and then his tones grew
      thrillingly distinct as he whispered me of a violated grave—of a
      disfigured body enshrouded, yet still breathing—still palpitating—&lt;i&gt;still
      alive&lt;/i&gt;!
    &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
      He pointed to garments;—they were muddy and clotted with gore. I
      spoke not, and he took me gently by the hand: it was indented with the
      impress of human nails. He directed my attention to some object against
      the wall. I looked at it for some minutes: it was a spade. With a shriek I
      bounded to the table, and grasped the box that lay upon it. But I could
      not force it open; and in my tremor, it slipped from my hands, and fell
      heavily, and burst into pieces; and from it, with a rattling sound, there
      rolled out some instruments of dental surgery, intermingled with
      thirty-two small, white and ivory-looking substances that were scattered
      to and fro about the floor.
    &lt;/p&gt;

                    —&lt;i&gt;Raymond Lully&lt;/i&gt;.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
      I am come of a race noted for vigor of fancy and ardor of passion. Men
      have called me mad; but the question is not yet settled, whether madness
      is or is not the loftiest intelligence—whether much that is glorious—whether
      all that is profound—does not spring from disease of thought—from
      moods of mind exalted at the expense of the general intellect. They who
      dream by day are cognizant of many things which escape those who dream
      only by night. In their gray visions they obtain glimpses of eternity, and
      thrill, in awakening, to find that they have been upon the verge of the
      great secret. In snatches, they learn something of the wisdom which is of
      good, and more of the mere knowledge which is of evil. They penetrate,
      however, rudderless or compassless into the vast ocean of the “light
      ineffable,” and again, like the adventures of the Nubian geographer,
      “agressi sunt mare tenebrarum, quid in eo esset exploraturi.”
     &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
      We will say, then, that I am mad. I grant, at least, that there are two
      distinct conditions of my mental existence—the condition of a lucid
      reason, not to be disputed, and belonging to the memory of events forming
      the first epoch of my life—and a condition of shadow and doubt,
      appertaining to the present, and to the recollection of what constitutes
      the second great era of my being. Therefore, what I shall tell of the
      earlier period, believe; and to what I may relate of the later time, give
      only such credit as may seem due, or doubt it altogether, or, if doubt it
      ye cannot, then play unto its riddle the Oedipus.
    &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
      She whom I loved in youth, and of whom I now pen calmly and distinctly
      these remembrances, was the sole daughter of the only sister of my mother
      long departed. Eleonora was the name of my cousin. We had always dwelled
      together, beneath a tropical sun, in the Valley of the Many-Colored Grass.
      No unguided footstep ever came upon that vale; for it lay away up among a
      range of giant hills that hung beetling around about it, shutting out the
      sunlight from its sweetest recesses. No path was trodden in its vicinity;
      and, to reach our happy home, there was need of putting back, with force,
      the foliage of many thousands of forest trees, and of crushing to death
      the glories of many millions of fragrant flowers. Thus it was that we
      lived all alone, knowing nothing of the world without the valley—I,
      and my cousin, and her mother.
    &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
      From the dim regions beyond the mountains at the upper end of our
      encircled domain, there crept out a narrow and deep river, brighter than
      all save the eyes of Eleonora; and, winding stealthily about in mazy
      courses, it passed away, at length, through a shadowy gorge, among hills
      still dimmer than those whence it had issued. We called it the “River of
      Silence”; for there seemed to be a hushing influence in its flow. No
      murmur arose from its bed, and so gently it wandered along, that the
      pearly pebbles upon which we loved to gaze, far down within its bosom,
      stirred not at all, but lay in a motionless content, each in its own old
      station, shining on gloriously forever.
    &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
      The margin of the river, and of the many dazzling rivulets that glided
      through devious ways into its channel, as well as the spaces that extended
      from the margins away down into the depths of the streams until they
      reached the bed of pebbles at the bottom,—these spots, not less than
      the whole surface of the valley, from the river to the mountains that
      girdled it in, were carpeted all by a soft green grass, thick, short,
      perfectly even, and vanilla-perfumed, but so besprinkled throughout with
      the yellow buttercup, the white daisy, the purple violet, and the ruby-red
      asphodel, that its exceeding beauty spoke to our hearts in loud tones, of
      the love and of the glory of God.
    &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
      And, here and there, in groves about this grass, like wildernesses of
      dreams, sprang up fantastic trees, whose tall slender stems stood not
      upright, but slanted gracefully toward the light that peered at noon-day
      into the centre of the valley. Their mark was speckled with the vivid
      alternate splendor of ebony and silver, and was smoother than all save the
      cheeks of Eleonora; so that, but for the brilliant green of the huge
      leaves that spread from their summits in long, tremulous lines, dallying
      with the Zephyrs, one might have fancied them giant serpents of Syria
      doing homage to their sovereign the Sun.
    &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
      Hand in hand about this valley, for fifteen years, roamed I with Eleonora
      before Love entered within our hearts. It was one evening at the close of
      the third lustrum of her life, and of the fourth of my own, that we sat,
      locked in each other’s embrace, beneath the serpent-like trees, and looked
      down within the water of the River of Silence at our images therein. We
      spoke no words during the rest of that sweet day, and our words even upon
      the morrow were tremulous and few. We had drawn the God Eros from that
      wave, and now we felt that he had enkindled within us the fiery souls of
      our forefathers. The passions which had for centuries distinguished our
      race, came thronging with the fancies for which they had been equally
      noted, and together breathed a delirious bliss over the Valley of the
      Many-Colored Grass. A change fell upon all things. Strange, brilliant
      flowers, star-shaped, burn out upon the trees where no flowers had been
      known before. The tints of the green carpet deepened; and when, one by
      one, the white daisies shrank away, there sprang up in place of them, ten
      by ten of the ruby-red asphodel. And life arose in our paths; for the tall
      flamingo, hitherto unseen, with all gay glowing birds, flaunted his
      scarlet plumage before us. The golden and silver fish haunted the river,
      out of the bosom of which issued, little by little, a murmur that swelled,
      at length, into a lulling melody more divine than that of the harp of
      Æolus—sweeter than all save the voice of Eleonora. And now, too, a
      voluminous cloud, which we had long watched in the regions of Hesper,
      floated out thence, all gorgeous in crimson and gold, and settling in
      peace above us, sank, day by day, lower and lower, until its edges rested
      upon the tops of the mountains, turning all their dimness into
      magnificence, and shutting us up, as if forever, within a magic
      prison-house of grandeur and of glory.
    &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
      The loveliness of Eleonora was that of the Seraphim; but she was a maiden
      artless and innocent as the brief life she had led among the flowers. No
      guile disguised the fervor of love which animated her heart, and she
      examined with me its inmost recesses as we walked together in the Valley
      of the Many-Colored Grass, and discoursed of the mighty changes which had
      lately taken place therein.
    &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
      At length, having spoken one day, in tears, of the last sad change which
      must befall Humanity, she thenceforward dwelt only upon this one sorrowful
      theme, interweaving it into all our converse, as, in the songs of the bard
      of Schiraz, the same images are found occurring, again and again, in every
      impressive variation of phrase.
    &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
      She had seen that the finger of Death was upon her bosom—that, like
      the ephemeron, she had been made perfect in loveliness only to die; but
      the terrors of the grave to her lay solely in a consideration which she
      revealed to me, one evening at twilight, by the banks of the River of
      Silence. She grieved to think that, having entombed her in the Valley of
      the Many-Colored Grass, I would quit forever its happy recesses,
      transferring the love which now was so passionately her own to some maiden
      of the outer and everyday world. And, then and there, I threw myself
      hurriedly at the feet of Eleonora, and offered up a vow, to herself and to
      Heaven, that I would never bind myself in marriage to any daughter of
      Earth—that I would in no manner prove recreant to her dear memory,
      or to the memory of the devout affection with which she had blessed me.
      And I called the Mighty Ruler of the Universe to witness the pious
      solemnity of my vow. And the curse which I invoked of Him and of her, a
      saint in Helusion should I prove traitorous to that promise, involved a
      penalty the exceeding great horror of which will not permit me to make
      record of it here. And the bright eyes of Eleonora grew brighter at my
      words; and she sighed as if a deadly burthen had been taken from her
      breast; and she trembled and very bitterly wept; but she made acceptance
      of the vow, (for what was she but a child?) and it made easy to her the
      bed of her death. And she said to me, not many days afterward, tranquilly
      dying, that, because of what I had done for the comfort of her spirit she
      would watch over me in that spirit when departed, and, if so it were
      permitted her return to me visibly in the watches of the night; but, if
      this thing were, indeed, beyond the power of the souls in Paradise, that
      she would, at least, give me frequent indications of her presence, sighing
      upon me in the evening winds, or filling the air which I breathed with
      perfume from the censers of the angels. And, with these words upon her
      lips, she yielded up her innocent life, putting an end to the first epoch
      of my own.
    &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
      Thus far I have faithfully said. But as I pass the barrier in Time’s path,
      formed by the death of my beloved, and proceed with the second era of my
      existence, I feel that a shadow gathers over my brain, and I mistrust the
      perfect sanity of the record. But let me on.—Years dragged
      themselves along heavily, and still I dwelled within the Valley of the
      Many-Colored Grass; but a second change had come upon all things. The
      star-shaped flowers shrank into the stems of the trees, and appeared no
      more. The tints of the green carpet faded; and, one by one, the ruby-red
      asphodels withered away; and there sprang up, in place of them, ten by
      ten, dark, eye-like violets, that writhed uneasily and were ever
      encumbered with dew. And Life departed from our paths; for the tall
      flamingo flaunted no longer his scarlet plumage before us, but flew sadly
      from the vale into the hills, with all the gay glowing birds that had
      arrived in his company. And the golden and silver fish swam down through
      the gorge at the lower end of our domain and bedecked the sweet river
      never again. And the lulling melody that had been softer than the
      wind-harp of Æolus, and more divine than all save the voice of Eleonora,
      it died little by little away, in murmurs growing lower and lower, until
      the stream returned, at length, utterly, into the solemnity of its
      original silence. And then, lastly, the voluminous cloud uprose, and,
      abandoning the tops of the mountains to the dimness of old, fell back into
      the regions of Hesper, and took away all its manifold golden and gorgeous
      glories from the Valley of the Many-Colored Grass.
    &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
      Yet the promises of Eleonora were not forgotten; for I heard the sounds of
      the swinging of the censers of the angels; and streams of a holy perfume
      floated ever and ever about the valley; and at lone hours, when my heart
      beat heavily, the winds that bathed my brow came unto me laden with soft
      sighs; and indistinct murmurs filled often the night air, and once—oh,
      but once only! I was awakened from a slumber, like the slumber of death,
      by the pressing of spiritual lips upon my own.
    &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
      But the void within my heart refused, even thus, to be filled. I longed
      for the love which had before filled it to overflowing. At length the
      valley pained me through its memories of Eleonora, and I left it for ever
      for the vanities and the turbulent triumphs of the world.
    &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
      I found myself within a strange city, where all things might have served
      to blot from recollection the sweet dreams I had dreamed so long in the
      Valley of the Many-Colored Grass. The pomps and pageantries of a stately
      court, and the mad clangor of arms, and the radiant loveliness of women,
      bewildered and intoxicated my brain. But as yet my soul had proved true to
      its vows, and the indications of the presence of Eleonora were still given
      me in the silent hours of the night. Suddenly these manifestations they
      ceased, and the world grew dark before mine eyes, and I stood aghast at
      the burning thoughts which possessed, at the terrible temptations which
      beset me; for there came from some far, far distant and unknown land, into
      the gay court of the king I served, a maiden to whose beauty my whole
      recreant heart yielded at once—at whose footstool I bowed down
      without a struggle, in the most ardent, in the most abject worship of
      love. What, indeed, was my passion for the young girl of the valley in
      comparison with the fervor, and the delirium, and the spirit-lifting
      ecstasy of adoration with which I poured out my whole soul in tears at the
      feet of the ethereal Ermengarde?—Oh, bright was the seraph
      Ermengarde! and in that knowledge I had room for none other. Oh,
      divine was the angel Ermengarde! and as I looked down into the depths of
      her memorial eyes, I thought only of them—and of her.
    &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
      I wedded—nor dreaded the curse I had invoked; and its bitterness
      was not visited upon me. And once—but once again in the silence of
      the night; there came through my lattice the soft sighs which had forsaken
      me; and they modelled themselves into familiar and sweet voice, saying:
    &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
      “Sleep in peace! for the Spirit of Love reigneth and ruleth, and, in
      taking to thy passionate heart her who is Ermengarde, thou art absolved,
      for reasons which shall be made known to thee in Heaven, of thy vows unto
      Eleonora.”

&lt;p&gt;
      (*1) The coralites.
    &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
      (*2) “One of the most remarkable natural curiosities in Texas is a
      petrified forest, near the head of Pasigno river. It consists of several
      hundred trees, in an erect position, all turned to stone. Some trees, now
      growing, are partly petrified. This is a startling fact for natural
      philosophers, and must cause them to modify the existing theory of
      petrification.—&lt;i&gt;Kennedy&lt;/i&gt;.
    &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
      This account, at first discredited, has since been corroborated by the
      discovery of a completely petrified forest, near the head waters of the
      Cheyenne, or Chienne river, which has its source in the Black Hills of the
      rocky chain.
    &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
      There is scarcely, perhaps, a spectacle on the surface of the globe more
      remarkable, either in a geological or picturesque point of view than that
      presented by the petrified forest, near Cairo. The traveller, having
      passed the tombs of the caliphs, just beyond the gates of the city,
      proceeds to the southward, nearly at right angles to the road across the
      desert to Suez, and after having travelled some ten miles up a low barren
      valley, covered with sand, gravel, and sea shells, fresh as if the tide
      had retired but yesterday, crosses a low range of sandhills, which has for
      some distance run parallel to his path. The scene now presented to him is
      beyond conception singular and desolate. A mass of fragments of trees, all
      converted into stone, and when struck by his horse’s hoof ringing like
      cast iron, is seen to extend itself for miles and miles around him, in the
      form of a decayed and prostrate forest. The wood is of a dark brown hue,
      but retains its form in perfection, the pieces being from one to fifteen
      feet in length, and from half a foot to three feet in thickness, strewed
      so closely together, as far as the eye can reach, that an Egyptian donkey
      can scarcely thread its way through amongst them, and so natural that,
      were it in Scotland or Ireland, it might pass without remark for some
      enormous drained bog, on which the exhumed trees lay rotting in the sun.
      The roots and rudiments of the branches are, in many cases, nearly
      perfect, and in some the worm-holes eaten under the bark are readily
      recognizable. The most delicate of the sap vessels, and all the finer
      portions of the centre of the wood, are perfectly entire, and bear to be
      examined with the strongest magnifiers. The whole are so thoroughly
      silicified as to scratch glass and are capable of receiving the highest
      polish.— &lt;i&gt;Asiatic Magazine&lt;/i&gt;.

      such a degree of darkness that, at Glaumba, which is more than fifty
      leagues from the mountain, people could only find their way by groping.
      During the eruption of Vesuvius, in 1794, at Caserta, four leagues
      distant, people could only walk by the light of torches. On the first of
      May, 1812, a cloud of volcanic ashes and sand, coming from a volcano in
      the island of St. Vincent, covered the whole of Barbadoes, spreading over
      it so intense a darkness that, at mid-day, in the open air, one could not
      perceive the trees or other objects near him, or even a white handkerchief
      placed at the distance of six inches from the eye.&lt;i&gt;“—Murray, p.

    &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
&lt;i&gt;Mr. J. B. Williams, of Salem, Mass.&lt;/i&gt;, presented the “National
      Institute” with an insect from New Zealand, with the following
      description: “‘&lt;i&gt;The Hotte&lt;/i&gt;, a decided caterpillar, or worm, is found
      gnawing at the root of the &lt;i&gt;Rota&lt;/i&gt; tree, with a plant growing out of
      its head. This most peculiar and extraordinary insect travels up both the
      &lt;i&gt;Rota&lt;/i&gt; and &lt;i&gt;Ferriri&lt;/i&gt; trees, and entering into the top, eats its
      way, perforating the trunk of the trees until it reaches the root, and
      dies, or remains dormant, and the plant propagates out of its head; the
      body remains perfect and entire, of a harder substance than when alive.
      From this insect the natives make a coloring for tattooing.
    &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
      (*13) In mines and natural caves we find a species of cryptogamous &lt;i&gt;fungus&lt;/i&gt;
      that emits an intense phosphorescence.

      (*14) The orchis, scabius and valisneria.
    &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
      (*15) The corolla of this flower (&lt;i&gt;Aristolochia Clematitis&lt;/i&gt;), which
      is tubular, but terminating upwards in a ligulate limb, is inflated into a
      globular figure at the base. The tubular part is internally beset with
      stiff hairs, pointing downwards. The globular part contains the pistil,
      which consists merely of a germen and stigma, together with the
      surrounding stamens. But the stamens, being shorter than the germen,
      cannot discharge the pollen so as to throw it upon the stigma, as the
      flower stands always upright till after impregnation. And hence, without
      some additional and peculiar aid, the pollen must necessarily fan down to
      the bottom of the flower. Now, the aid that nature has furnished in this
      case, is that of the &lt;i&gt;Tiputa Pennicornis&lt;/i&gt;, a small insect, which
      entering the tube of the corrolla in quest of honey, descends to the
      bottom, and rummages about till it becomes quite covered with pollen; but
      not being able to force its way out again, owing to the downward position
      of the hairs, which converge to a point like the wires of a mouse-trap,
      and being somewhat impatient of its confinement it brushes backwards and
      forwards, trying every corner, till, after repeatedly traversing the
      stigma, it covers it with pollen sufficient for its impregnation, in
      consequence of which the flower soon begins to droop, and the hairs to
      shrink to the sides of the tube, effecting an easy passage for the escape
      of the insect.”—&lt;i&gt;Rev. P. Keith-System of Physiological Botany&lt;/i&gt;.
    &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
      (*16) The bees—ever since bees were—have been constructing
      their cells with just such sides, in just such number, and at just such
      inclinations, as it has been demonstrated (in a problem involving the
      profoundest mathematical principles) are the very sides, in the very
      number, and at the very angles, which will afford the creatures the most
      room that is compatible with the greatest stability of structure.
    &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
      During the latter part of the last century, the question arose among
      mathematicians—“to determine the best form that can be given to the
      sails of a windmill, according to their varying distances from the
      revolving vanes, and likewise from the centres of the revolution.” This
      is an excessively complex problem, for it is, in other words, to find the
      best possible position at an infinity of varied distances and at an
      infinity of points on the arm. There were a thousand futile attempts to
      answer the query on the part of the most illustrious mathematicians, and
      when at length, an undeniable solution was discovered, men found that the
      wings of a bird had given it with absolute precision ever since the first
      bird had traversed the air.

      (*31) Common experiments in Natural Philosophy. If two red rays from two
      luminous points be admitted into a dark chamber so as to fall on a white
      surface, and differ in their length by 0.0000258 of an inch, their
      intensity is doubled. So also if the difference in length be any
      whole-number multiple of that fraction. A multiple by 2 1/4, 3 1/4, &amp;amp;c.,
      gives an intensity equal to one ray only; but a multiple by 2 1/2, 3 1/2,
      &amp;amp;c., gives the result of total darkness. In violet rays similar
      effects arise when the difference in length is 0.000157 of an inch; and
      with all other rays the results are the same—the difference varying
      with a uniform increase from the violet to the red.

      atmosphere of its own, it does not, in fact, touch the sides. A few drops
      of water are now introduced, when the acid, immediately coming in contact
      with the heated sides of the crucible, flies off in sulphurous acid vapor,
      and so rapid is its progress, that the caloric of the water passes off
      with it, which falls a lump of ice to the bottom; by taking advantage of
      the moment before it is allowed to remelt, it may be turned out a lump of
      ice from a red-hot vessel.

&lt;p&gt;
      (*34) Although light travels 167,000 miles in a second, the distance of 61
      Cygni (the only star whose distance is ascertained) is so inconceivably
      great, that its rays would require more than ten years to reach the earth.
      For stars beyond this, 20—or even 1000 years—would be a
      moderate estimate. Thus, if they had been annihilated 20, or 1000 years
      ago, we might still see them to-day by the light which started from their
      surfaces 20 or 1000 years in the past time. That many which we see daily
      are really extinct, is not impossible—not even improbable.

      and justly observes that “in the contemplation of so vast a sum, and of
      the services to which it might be applied, there is something even of the
      sublime.” To suit the views of this article I have followed the Prince’s
      statement, although a grossly exaggerated one. The germ, and in fact, the
      commencement of the present paper was published many years ago—previous
      to the issue of the first number of Sue’s admirable &lt;i&gt;Juif Errant&lt;/i&gt;,
      which may possibly have been suggested to him by Muskau’s account.

Updated editions will replace the previous one—the old editions will
be renamed.

&lt;div style=&#34;display:block; margin:1em 0&#34;&gt;
Creating the works from print editions not protected by U.S. copyright
law means that no one owns a United States copyright in these works,
so the Foundation (and you!) can copy and distribute it in the United
States without permission and without paying copyright
royalties. Special rules, set forth in the General Terms of Use part
of this license, apply to copying and distributing Project
Gutenberg™ electronic works to protect the PROJECT GUTENBERG™
concept and trademark. Project Gutenberg is a registered trademark,
and may not be used if you charge for an eBook, except by following
the terms of the trademark license, including paying royalties for use
of the Project Gutenberg trademark. If you do not charge anything for
copies of this eBook, complying with the trademark license is very
easy. You may use this eBook for nearly any purpose such as creation
of derivative works, reports, performances and research. Project
Gutenberg eBooks may be modified and printed and given away—you may
do practically ANYTHING in the United States with eBooks not protected
by U.S. copyright law. Redistribution is subject to the trademark
license, especially commercial redistribution.

&lt;div style=&#34;text-align:center;font-size:0.9em&#34;&gt;PLEASE READ THIS BEFORE YOU DISTRIBUTE OR USE THIS WORK&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div style=&#34;display:block; margin:1em 0&#34;&gt;
To protect the Project Gutenberg™ mission of promoting the free
distribution of electronic works, by using or distributing this work
(or any other work associated in any way with the phrase “Project
Gutenberg”), you agree to comply with all the terms of the Full
Project Gutenberg™ License available with this file or online at
www.gutenberg.org/license.
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div style=&#34;display:block; font-size:1.1em; margin:1em 0; font-weight:bold&#34;&gt;
Section 1. General Terms of Use and Redistributing Project Gutenberg™ electronic works
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div style=&#34;display:block; margin:1em 0&#34;&gt;
1.A. By reading or using any part of this Project Gutenberg™
electronic work, you indicate that you have read, understand, agree to
and accept all the terms of this license and intellectual property
(trademark/copyright) agreement. If you do not agree to abide by all
the terms of this agreement, you must cease using and return or
destroy all copies of Project Gutenberg™ electronic works in your
possession. If you paid a fee for obtaining a copy of or access to a
Project Gutenberg™ electronic work and you do not agree to be bound
by the terms of this agreement, you may obtain a refund from the person
or entity to whom you paid the fee as set forth in paragraph 1.E.8.
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div style=&#34;display:block; margin:1em 0&#34;&gt;
1.B. “Project Gutenberg” is a registered trademark. It may only be
used on or associated in any way with an electronic work by people who
agree to be bound by the terms of this agreement. There are a few
things that you can do with most Project Gutenberg™ electronic works
even without complying with the full terms of this agreement. See
paragraph 1.C below. There are a lot of things you can do with Project
Gutenberg™ electronic works if you follow the terms of this
agreement and help preserve free future access to Project Gutenberg™
electronic works. See paragraph 1.E below.
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div style=&#34;display:block; margin:1em 0&#34;&gt;
1.C. The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation (“the
Foundation” or PGLAF), owns a compilation copyright in the collection
of Project Gutenberg™ electronic works. Nearly all the individual
works in the collection are in the public domain in the United
States. If an individual work is unprotected by copyright law in the
United States and you are located in the United States, we do not
claim a right to prevent you from copying, distributing, performing,
displaying or creating derivative works based on the work as long as
all references to Project Gutenberg are removed. Of course, we hope
that you will support the Project Gutenberg™ mission of promoting
free access to electronic works by freely sharing Project Gutenberg™
works in compliance with the terms of this agreement for keeping the
Project Gutenberg™ name associated with the work. You can easily
comply with the terms of this agreement by keeping this work in the
same format with its attached full Project Gutenberg™ License when
you share it without charge with others.
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div style=&#34;display:block; margin:1em 0&#34;&gt;
1.D. The copyright laws of the place where you are located also govern
what you can do with this work. Copyright laws in most countries are
in a constant state of change. If you are outside the United States,
check the laws of your country in addition to the terms of this
agreement before downloading, copying, displaying, performing,
distributing or creating derivative works based on this work or any
other Project Gutenberg™ work. The Foundation makes no
representations concerning the copyright status of any work in any
country other than the United States.
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div style=&#34;display:block; margin:1em 0&#34;&gt;
1.E. Unless you have removed all references to Project Gutenberg:
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div style=&#34;display:block; margin:1em 0&#34;&gt;
1.E.1. The following sentence, with active links to, or other
immediate access to, the full Project Gutenberg™ License must appear
prominently whenever any copy of a Project Gutenberg™ work (any work
on which the phrase “Project Gutenberg” appears, or with which the
phrase “Project Gutenberg” is associated) is accessed, displayed,
performed, viewed, copied or distributed:
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;div style=&#34;display:block; margin:1em 0&#34;&gt;
    This eBook is for the use of anyone anywhere in the United States and most
    other parts of the world at no cost and with almost no restrictions
    whatsoever. You may copy it, give it away or re-use it under the terms
    of the Project Gutenberg License included with this eBook or online
    at &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.gutenberg.org&#34;&gt;www.gutenberg.org&lt;/a&gt;. If you
    are not located in the United States, you will have to check the laws
    of the country where you are located before using this eBook.
  &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;div style=&#34;display:block; margin:1em 0&#34;&gt;
1.E.2. If an individual Project Gutenberg™ electronic work is
derived from texts not protected by U.S. copyright law (does not
contain a notice indicating that it is posted with permission of the
copyright holder), the work can be copied and distributed to anyone in
the United States without paying any fees or charges. If you are
redistributing or providing access to a work with the phrase “Project
Gutenberg” associated with or appearing on the work, you must comply
either with the requirements of paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 or
obtain permission for the use of the work and the Project Gutenberg™
trademark as set forth in paragraphs 1.E.8 or 1.E.9.
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div style=&#34;display:block; margin:1em 0&#34;&gt;
1.E.3. If an individual Project Gutenberg™ electronic work is posted
with the permission of the copyright holder, your use and distribution
must comply with both paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 and any
additional terms imposed by the copyright holder. Additional terms
will be linked to the Project Gutenberg™ License for all works
posted with the permission of the copyright holder found at the
beginning of this work.
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div style=&#34;display:block; margin:1em 0&#34;&gt;
1.E.4. Do not unlink or detach or remove the full Project Gutenberg™
License terms from this work, or any files containing a part of this
work or any other work associated with Project Gutenberg™.
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div style=&#34;display:block; margin:1em 0&#34;&gt;
1.E.5. Do not copy, display, perform, distribute or redistribute this
electronic work, or any part of this electronic work, without
prominently displaying the sentence set forth in paragraph 1.E.1 with
active links or immediate access to the full terms of the Project
Gutenberg™ License.
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div style=&#34;display:block; margin:1em 0&#34;&gt;
1.E.6. You may convert to and distribute this work in any binary,
compressed, marked up, nonproprietary or proprietary form, including
any word processing or hypertext form. However, if you provide access
to or distribute copies of a Project Gutenberg™ work in a format
other than “Plain Vanilla ASCII” or other format used in the official
version posted on the official Project Gutenberg™ website
(www.gutenberg.org), you must, at no additional cost, fee or expense
to the user, provide a copy, a means of exporting a copy, or a means
of obtaining a copy upon request, of the work in its original “Plain
Vanilla ASCII” or other form. Any alternate format must include the
full Project Gutenberg™ License as specified in paragraph 1.E.1.
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div style=&#34;display:block; margin:1em 0&#34;&gt;
1.E.7. Do not charge a fee for access to, viewing, displaying,
performing, copying or distributing any Project Gutenberg™ works
unless you comply with paragraph 1.E.8 or 1.E.9.
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div style=&#34;display:block; margin:1em 0&#34;&gt;
1.E.8. You may charge a reasonable fee for copies of or providing
access to or distributing Project Gutenberg™ electronic works
provided that:
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div style=&#34;margin-left:0.7em;&#34;&gt;
&lt;div style=&#34;text-indent:-0.7em&#34;&gt;
        • You pay a royalty fee of 20% of the gross profits you derive from
        the use of Project Gutenberg™ works calculated using the method
        you already use to calculate your applicable taxes. The fee is owed
        to the owner of the Project Gutenberg™ trademark, but he has
        agreed to donate royalties under this paragraph to the Project
        Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation. Royalty payments must be paid
        within 60 days following each date on which you prepare (or are
        legally required to prepare) your periodic tax returns. Royalty
        payments should be clearly marked as such and sent to the Project
        Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation at the address specified in
        Section 4, “Information about donations to the Project Gutenberg
        Literary Archive Foundation.”
    &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div style=&#34;text-indent:-0.7em&#34;&gt;
        • You provide a full refund of any money paid by a user who notifies
        you in writing (or by e-mail) within 30 days of receipt that s/he
        does not agree to the terms of the full Project Gutenberg™
        License. You must require such a user to return or destroy all
        copies of the works possessed in a physical medium and discontinue
        all use of and all access to other copies of Project Gutenberg™
        works.
    &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div style=&#34;text-indent:-0.7em&#34;&gt;
        • You provide, in accordance with paragraph 1.F.3, a full refund of
        any money paid for a work or a replacement copy, if a defect in the
        electronic work is discovered and reported to you within 90 days of
        receipt of the work.
    &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div style=&#34;text-indent:-0.7em&#34;&gt;
        • You comply with all other terms of this agreement for free
        distribution of Project Gutenberg™ works.
    &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div style=&#34;display:block; margin:1em 0&#34;&gt;
1.E.9. If you wish to charge a fee or distribute a Project
Gutenberg™ electronic work or group of works on different terms than
are set forth in this agreement, you must obtain permission in writing
from the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the manager of
the Project Gutenberg™ trademark. Contact the Foundation as set
forth in Section 3 below.
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div style=&#34;display:block; margin:1em 0&#34;&gt;
1.F.
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div style=&#34;display:block; margin:1em 0&#34;&gt;
1.F.1. Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
works not protected by U.S. copyright law in creating the Project
Gutenberg™ collection. Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg™
electronic works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may
contain “Defects,” such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate
or corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other
intellectual property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or
other medium, a computer virus, or computer codes that damage or
cannot be read by your equipment.
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div style=&#34;display:block; margin:1em 0&#34;&gt;
1.F.2. LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the “Right
of Replacement or Refund” described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
Gutenberg™ trademark, and any other party distributing a Project
Gutenberg™ electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all
liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including legal
fees. YOU AGREE THAT YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE, STRICT
LIABILITY, BREACH OF WARRANTY OR BREACH OF CONTRACT EXCEPT THOSE
PROVIDED IN PARAGRAPH 1.F.3. YOU AGREE THAT THE FOUNDATION, THE
TRADEMARK OWNER, AND ANY DISTRIBUTOR UNDER THIS AGREEMENT WILL NOT BE
LIABLE TO YOU FOR ACTUAL, DIRECT, INDIRECT, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE OR
INCIDENTAL DAMAGES EVEN IF YOU GIVE NOTICE OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH
DAMAGE.
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div style=&#34;display:block; margin:1em 0&#34;&gt;
1.F.3. LIMITED RIGHT OF REPLACEMENT OR REFUND - If you discover a
defect in this electronic work within 90 days of receiving it, you can
receive a refund of the money (if any) you paid for it by sending a
written explanation to the person you received the work from. If you
received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium
with your written explanation. The person or entity that provided you
with the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in
lieu of a refund. If you received the work electronically, the person
or entity providing it to you may choose to give you a second
opportunity to receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund. If
the second copy is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing
without further opportunities to fix the problem.
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div style=&#34;display:block; margin:1em 0&#34;&gt;
1.F.4. Except for the limited right of replacement or refund set forth
in paragraph 1.F.3, this work is provided to you ‘AS-IS’, WITH NO
OTHER WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT
LIMITED TO WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY OR FITNESS FOR ANY PURPOSE.
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div style=&#34;display:block; margin:1em 0&#34;&gt;
1.F.5. Some states do not allow disclaimers of certain implied
warranties or the exclusion or limitation of certain types of
damages. If any disclaimer or limitation set forth in this agreement
violates the law of the state applicable to this agreement, the
agreement shall be interpreted to make the maximum disclaimer or
limitation permitted by the applicable state law. The invalidity or
unenforceability of any provision of this agreement shall not void the
remaining provisions.
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div style=&#34;display:block; margin:1em 0&#34;&gt;
1.F.6. INDEMNITY - You agree to indemnify and hold the Foundation, the
trademark owner, any agent or employee of the Foundation, anyone
providing copies of Project Gutenberg™ electronic works in
accordance with this agreement, and any volunteers associated with the
production, promotion and distribution of Project Gutenberg™
electronic works, harmless from all liability, costs and expenses,
including legal fees, that arise directly or indirectly from any of
the following which you do or cause to occur: (a) distribution of this
or any Project Gutenberg™ work, (b) alteration, modification, or
additions or deletions to any Project Gutenberg™ work, and (c) any
Defect you cause.
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div style=&#34;display:block; font-size:1.1em; margin:1em 0; font-weight:bold&#34;&gt;
Section 2. Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg™
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div style=&#34;display:block; margin:1em 0&#34;&gt;
Project Gutenberg™ is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of
computers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It
exists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations
from people in all walks of life.
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div style=&#34;display:block; margin:1em 0&#34;&gt;
Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg™’s
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg™ collection will
remain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg™ and future
generations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see
Sections 3 and 4 and the Foundation information page at www.gutenberg.org.
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div style=&#34;display:block; font-size:1.1em; margin:1em 0; font-weight:bold&#34;&gt;
Section 3. Information about the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div style=&#34;display:block; margin:1em 0&#34;&gt;
The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation is a non-profit
501(c)(3) educational corporation organized under the laws of the
state of Mississippi and granted tax exempt status by the Internal
Revenue Service. The Foundation’s EIN or federal tax identification
number is 64-6221541. Contributions to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation are tax deductible to the full extent permitted by
U.S. federal laws and your state’s laws.
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div style=&#34;display:block; margin:1em 0&#34;&gt;
The Foundation’s business office is located at 809 North 1500 West,
Salt Lake City, UT 84116, (801) 596-1887. Email contact links and up

&lt;div style=&#34;display:block; font-size:1.1em; margin:1em 0; font-weight:bold&#34;&gt;
Section 4. Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div style=&#34;display:block; margin:1em 0&#34;&gt;
Project Gutenberg™ depends upon and cannot survive without widespread
public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine-readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div style=&#34;display:block; margin:1em 0&#34;&gt;
The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND
DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular state
visit &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.gutenberg.org/donate/&#34;&gt;www.gutenberg.org/donate&lt;/a&gt;.
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div style=&#34;display:block; margin:1em 0&#34;&gt;
While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div style=&#34;display:block; margin:1em 0&#34;&gt;
International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div style=&#34;display:block; margin:1em 0&#34;&gt;
Please check the Project Gutenberg web pages for current donation
methods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To
donate, please visit: www.gutenberg.org/donate
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div style=&#34;display:block; font-size:1.1em; margin:1em 0; font-weight:bold&#34;&gt;
Section 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg™ electronic works
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div style=&#34;display:block; margin:1em 0&#34;&gt;
Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project
Gutenberg™ concept of a library of electronic works that could be
freely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and
distributed Project Gutenberg™ eBooks with only a loose network of
volunteer support.
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div style=&#34;display:block; margin:1em 0&#34;&gt;
Project Gutenberg™ eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in
the U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not
necessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper
edition.
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div style=&#34;display:block; margin:1em 0&#34;&gt;
Most people start at our website which has the main PG search
facility: &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.gutenberg.org&#34;&gt;www.gutenberg.org&lt;/a&gt;.
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div style=&#34;display:block; margin:1em 0&#34;&gt;
This website includes information about Project Gutenberg™,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/section&gt;&lt;/body&gt;
