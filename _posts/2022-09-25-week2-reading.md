“The Digital Humanities: A Primer for Students and Scholars" by Eileen Gardiner and Ronald Musto

The question the introduction of this piece tries to answer is, what are the digital humanities? Unlike asking a physicist to define gravity, there is no clear definition of the digital humanities (1). Some describe it as the practice of humanities scholars collaborating “with computer scientists to build tools that [facilitate] the work of the digital humanities” (3), but that definition does not fully describe what the digital humanities are. Anne Burdick gives a more general definition in their book Digital_Humanities, “[Digital humanities] asks what it means to be a human being in the networked information age…” (4). I personally like this definition as it defines the difference between the humanities and the digital humanities quite clearly. 

My definition of the digital humanities is, that it is the study of what it means to be human in the age of the internet. Often we do this through the use of technology as technology can better help us study the humanities, but the use of digital tools is not a mandatory part of the digital humanities. I know this definition can be imprecise, but there are many different fields of the digital humanities.
