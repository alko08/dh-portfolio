"An Overview of The Decline and Fall of the Roman Empire." by J.G. A. Pocock

J.G. A. Pocock brings an interesting perspective to his analysis of Edward Gibbon’s work. For one, he likes the work Edward Gibbon did, and even makes the last line of his piece a compliment to Edward Gibbon. He writes that "the majesty of Gibbon’s style as he moves from
one narrative to another is what gives his work unity" (39).

While Pocock might enjoy Edward Gibbon’s style, he is not afraid to point out where Edward Gibbon went wrong. In particular, Pocock highlights how Edward Gibbon often ends important sections with chapters that barely connect to the reading as a whole. An excellent example is how after writing about the fall of Constantinople, “Gibbon does what he has done before, and adds three chapters on topics only indirectly related to his immediate narrative” (38).
